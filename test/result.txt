THE ********** ******* ******* 3.0




******* I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was ********* to get very tired of sitting by her ****** on the
bank, and of having ******* to do: once or ***** she had peeped into the
book her ****** was *******, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ ******* Alice ‘******* *******s or
************s?’

So she was con******** in her own mind (as***** as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very ****** and ******), ******* the ********
of making a *****-***** ***** be worth the trouble of ******* up and
******* the daisies, when ******ly a ***** *****t with pink eyes ran
***** by her.

***** was ******* so VERY ********** in that; nor did Alice ***** it so
VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear!
Oh dear! I ***** be*****!’ (when she ******* it over *****wards, it
*****red to her that she ***** to have ******** at this, but at the time
it all seemed ***** *******); but when the *****t ******** TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then ******* on,
Alice *****ed to her feet, for it flashed ****** her mind that she had
***** ****** seen a rabbit with e***** a *********-******, or a watch
to take out of it, and ******* with curiosity, she ran ****** the *****
***** it, and *********** was just in time to see it pop down a large
*****t-hole under the hedge.

In another ****** down went Alice ***** it, ***** once con******** how
in the world she was to get out *****.

The *****t-hole went ******** on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped ******ly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a ****** to think
***** ******** ******* ****** she ***** ******* ******* down a very deep
well.

****** the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
****** of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
***** to happen next. *****, she ***** to look down and make out what
she was ****** to, but it was too dark to see ********; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and ******d that they were filled with
********s and book-s*****s; here and there she saw maps and *******s
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the s****** as
she passed; it was *****led ‘****** *********’, but to her *****
************** it was *****: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the ********s as
she fell past it.

‘Well!’ ******* Alice to herself, ‘***** such a fall as this, I *****
***** ******* of tumbling down stairs! How ***** they’ll all think me at
home! Why, I *****n’t say ******** ***** it, even if I fell off the top
of the house!’ (***** was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. ***** the fall NEVER come to an end! ‘I ****** how
many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be *******
********* near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that ***** be four
******** miles down, I *****--’ (for, you see, Alice had *****t *******
*****s of this sort in her ******s in the schoolroom, and ****** this
was not a VERY good *********** for ******* off her *********, as there
was no one to ****** to her, ***** it was good practice to say it over)
‘--yes, that’s ***** the ***** ********--but then I ****** what ********
or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what ******** was, or
********* ******, but ******* they were nice ***** ***** to say.)

********* she began *****. ‘I ****** if I shall fall ***** ******* the
*****! How ***** it’ll seem to come out among the ****** that walk with
***** heads ********! The Antipathies, I *****--’ (she was ****** glad
***** WAS no one listening, this*****, as it didn’t ***** at all the
***** word) ‘--but I ***** have to ask them what the name of the *******
is, you know. ******, Ma’am, is this New Ze***** or A******ia?’ (and
she ***** to curtsey as she *****--***** CURTSEYING as you’re falling
******* the air! Do you think you ***** ****** it?) ‘And what an
******** ****** girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to
ask: ******* I ***** see it written up somewhere.’

Down, down, down. ***** was ******* else to do, so Alice soon began
******* *****. ‘Dinah’ll miss me***** much to-*****, I ****** *****!’
(Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her ****** of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! ***** are no
mice in the air, I’m ******, but you ***** ***** a bat, and that’s very
like a *****, you know. But do cats eat bats, I ******?’ And here Alice
began to get ****** ******, and went on ****** to herself, in a dreamy
sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and *********, ‘Do
bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t ****** ****** ********,
it didn’t much m***** ***** way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to ***** that she was ******* hand in hand with
Dinah, and ****** to her very*****estly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the *****:
did you ever eat a bat?’ when ******ly, *****! *****! down she came upon
a heap of *****s and dry ******, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a ******:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; ****** her was *******
long passage, and the ***** *****t was ***** in sight, *****ing down it.
***** was not a ****** to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a ******, ‘Oh my ears
and *******s, how late it’s *******!’ She was ***** ****** it when she
turned the ******, but the *****t was no longer to be seen: she *****
******* in a*****, low hall, ***** was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

***** were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, ****** *****
door, she walked ***** down the middle, ******ing how she was ever to
get out *****.

******ly she came upon a ****** *****-****** *****, all made of *****
*****; ***** was ******* on it ****** a tiny ****** key, and Alice’s
***** ******* was that it might ****** to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! ****** the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. *******, on the second
time *****, she came upon a low ******* she had not ******d ******, and
****** it was a ****** door about fifteen inches high: she ***** the
****** ****** key in the lock, and to her ***** ******* it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she ***** down and looked ***** the *******
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she *****d to get out of
that dark hall, and ****** ***** among ***** beds of ****** ******s and
***** cool fountains, but she ***** not even get her head th***** the
*******; ‘and even if my head would go *******,’ ******* poor Alice, ‘it
***** be of very little use ******* my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a *********! I ***** I *****, if I only knew how to begin.’
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had ******ed ******,
that Alice had ***** to think that very few *****s ****** were r*****
**********.

***** seemed to be no use in waiting by the ****** door, so she went
back to the *****, half hoping she ***** find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting ****** up like *********s: this
time she ***** a ****** ****** on it, [‘***** ********* was not here
******,’ said Alice,) and ***** the neck of the ****** was a *****
*****, with the words ‘***** ME’ *********ly *****ed on it in large
******s.

It was all very well to say ‘***** me,’ but the wise ****** Alice was
not ***** to do THAT in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look *****,’ she said, ‘and
see ******* it’s ****** “******” or not’; for she had read several nice
****** histories ***** ******** who had got *****, and eaten up by wild
*****s and ***** ********** *****s, all ******* they WOULD not rem*****
the ****** rules ***** ******s had ****** them: such as, that a red-hot
***** will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
****** VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had *****
********* that, if you drink much from a ****** ****** ‘******,’ it is
****** ******* to dis***** with you, ****** or later.

*******, this bottle was NOT ****** ‘******,’ so Alice *******d to taste
it, and ******* it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of ***** flavour
of cherry-tart, *******, pine-*****, ***** ******, toffee, and hot
******ed *****,) she very soon ******** it off.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

‘What a ******* *******!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a
*********.’

And so it was ******: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
********ed up at the ******* that she was now the ***** size for *****
******* the ****** door into that ****** ******. *****, *******, she
waited for a few ******s to see if she was ***** to shrink any *******:
she felt a little ******* ***** this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said
Alice to herself, ‘in my ***** out **********, like a ******. I ******
what I ****** be like then?’ And she ***** to fancy what the ***** of a
****** is like ***** the ****** is blown out, for she ***** not ********
ever having seen such a *****.

***** a *****, ******* that ******* more happened, she ******* on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she ***** she had ********* the ****** ****** key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she ***** she ***** not ******** *****
it: she ***** see it quite ******* ******* the *****, and she ***** her
best to ***** up one of the legs of the *****, but it was too ********;
and when she had ***** ******* out with trying, the poor little *****
sat down and cried.

‘Come, *****’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself,
****** *******; ‘I ****** you to leave off this ******!’ She *********
gave herself very good advice, (****** she very seldom ******ed it),
and ********* she *****ed ******* so severely as to ***** tears into
her eyes; and once she rem*****ed ****** to box her own ears for having
*****ed ******* in a game of c****** she was ******* ******* *******,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two ******.
‘But it’s no use now,’ ******* poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people!
Why, *****’s ****** ****** of me left to make ONE respectable person!’

Soon her eye fell on a little ***** box that was ***** ***** the *****:
she opened it, and ***** in it a very small cake, on which the words
‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said
Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow *****r, I can ***** the key; and if it
makes me grow *****er, I can ***** ***** the door; so e***** way I’ll
get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’

She ate a ****** bit, and said anxiously to *******, ‘***** way? *****
way?’, ******* her hand on the top of her head to feel ***** way it was
growing, and she was ***** ********d to find that she ******ed the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of ******ing nothing but out-of-the-way
*****s to happen, that it seemed ***** dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon ******** off the cake.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *




******* II. The Pool of Tears

‘*******er and *******er!’ ***** Alice (she was so much ********d, that
for the ****** she ***** ****** how to speak good *******); ‘now I’m
******* out like the *****st ********* that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be ****** out of
*****, they were ******* so far off). ‘Oh, my poor ****** feet, I ******
who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure
_I_ shan’t be able! I ***** be a great deal too far off to trouble
****** ***** you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
kind to them,’ ******* Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want
to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of ***** ***** *********.’

And she went on planning to ******* how she ***** ****** it. ‘They must
go by the *******,’ she *******; ‘and how ***** it’ll seem, sending
*******s to one’s own feet! And how odd the *********s will look!

     ALICE’S ***** FOOT, ESQ.
       ******RUG,
         NEAR THE FENDER,
           (WITH ALICE’S LOVE).

Oh dear, what ******** I’m *******!’

Just then her head s***** ******* the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet*****, and she at once took up the ****** ******
key and ******* off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, ***** down on one side, to
look th***** into the garden with one eye; but to get ******* was more
******** than ever: she sat down and began to cry *****.

‘You ***** to be ******* of yourself,’ said Alice, ‘a ***** girl like
you,’ (she ***** well say this), ‘to go on crying in this way! Stop this
******, I tell you!’ But she went on all the same, ******** ******s of
tears, ***** ***** was a ***** pool all round her, ***** four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.

***** a time she ***** a ****** ******ing of feet in the ********, and
she ******* ***** her eyes to see what was ******. It was the *****
*****t ******ing, ********** *****ed, with a***** of white kid *****s in
one hand and a large fan in the *****: he came trotting along in a *****
*****, ******ing to ******* as he came, ‘Oh! the *******, the *******!
Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her *******!’ Alice felt so
********* that she was ***** to ask help of any one; so, when the *****t
came near her, she began, in a low, ***** *****, ‘If you p*****, sir--’
The *****t *****ed *********, dropped the ***** kid *****s and the fan,
and skurried away into the darkness as***** as he ***** go.

Alice took up the fan and *****s, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on *******: ‘Dear, dear! How
***** ********** is to-day! And ********* *****s went on just as *****.
I ****** if I’ve been ******d in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this *******? I ****** ***** I can ******** ******* a
****** *********. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, THAT’S the ***** ******!’ And she began ********
over all the children she knew that were of the same age as *******, to
see if she could have been changed for any of them.

‘I’m sure I’m not Ada,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes in such long
*******s, and mine doesn’t go in *******s at all; and I’m sure I can’t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! *******, SHE’S she, and I’m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
it all is! I’ll try if I know all the *****s I used to know. Let me
see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
four times ***** is--oh dear! I ***** ***** get to twenty at that rate!
*******, the ************** ***** doesn’t *******: let’s try *********.
****** is the capital of *****, and ***** is the capital of Rome, and
Rome--no, THAT’S all *****, I’m *******! I must***** been changed for
Mabel! I’ll try and say “How doth the little--“’ and she ******d her
hands on her lap as if she were ****** ******s, and began to repeat it,
but her ***** *****ed ****** and *******, and the ***** did not come the
same as they used to do:--

     ‘How doth the little *********
      ******* his ******* tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On*****y ****** *****!

     ‘How ********** he seems to grin,
      How ****** ****** his claws,
     And ******* ****** fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!’

‘I’m sure ***** are not the ***** *****,’ said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, ‘I must be Mabel ***** all, and
I ***** have to go and live in that poky little *****, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to *****! No, I’ve
made up my mind ***** it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no
use ***** ******* ***** heads down and saying “Come up *****, dear!” I
***** only look up and say “Who am I then? Tell me that *****, and then,
if I like ***** that ******, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here
till I’m ******** else”--but, oh dear!’ ***** Alice, with a sudden *****
of tears, ‘I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
of being all alone here!’

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was ********d to see
that she had put on one of the *****t’s ****** ***** kid *****s *****
she was *******. ‘How CAN I have done that?’ she *******. ‘I must
be growing small again.’ She got up and went to the table to *******
******* by it, and ***** that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
***** two feet*****, and was ***** on sh******* *******: she soon found
out that the ***** of this was the fan she was *******, and she dropped
it hastily, just in time to avoid sh******* away altog*****.

‘That WAS a ****** ******!’ said Alice, a good deal ********ed at the
****** ******, but very glad to find ******* ***** in existence; ‘and
now for the ******!’ and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
but, alas! the ****** door was shut *****, and the ****** ****** key was
***** on the glass****** as before, ‘and *****s are ***** than ever,’
******* the poor child, ‘for I ***** was so small as this before, *****!
And I ******* it’s too bad, that it is!’

As she said ***** ***** her foot slipped, and in another ******, ******!
she was up to her chin in salt *****. Her ***** idea was that she
had ******* ****** into the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by
ra*****,’ she said to *******. (Alice had been to the ******* once in
her life, and had come to the ******* **********, that ******** you go
to on the ******* ***** you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children ******* in the sand with wooden *****s, then a row
of lodging houses, and ****** them a ra***** *******.) *******, she soon
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet*****.

‘I wish I hadn’t ***** so much!’ said Alice, as she swam *****, ******
to find her way out. ‘I ***** be punished for it now, I *******, by
***** *****ed in my own tears! That WILL be a ***** *****, to be sure!
*******, ********** is queer to-day.’

Just then she ***** ********* ******ing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she *******
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she ********ed how *****
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

‘***** it be of any use, now,’ ******* Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse?
********** is so out-of-the-way down here, that I ****** ***** very
****** it can talk: at any rate, *****’s no harm in trying.’ So she
began: ‘O *****, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very *****
of swimming ***** here, O *****!’ (Alice ******* this must be the right
way of s******* to a mouse: she had ***** done such a ***** ******, but
she ********ed ****** seen in her *******’s ***** *******, ‘A *****--of
a *****--to a mouse--a *****--O *****!’) The ***** looked at her ******
*************, and seemed to her to wink with one of its ****** eyes,
but it said *******.

‘******* it doesn’t ********** *******,’ ******* Alice; ‘I daresay it’s
a ****** *****, come over with William the Conqueror.’ (For, with all
her ********* of history, Alice had no very ***** ****** how long ago
******** had ******ed.) So she began again: ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ *****
was the ***** ******** in her French ******-book. The ***** gave a
****** leap out of the *****, and seemed to quiver all over with ******.
‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ ***** Alice *******, ****** that she had hurt
the poor animal’s *******s. ‘I ***** ****** you didn’t like cats.’

‘Not like cats!’ ***** the *****, in a shrill, ********** *****. ‘*****
YOU like cats if you were me?’

‘Well, ******* not,’ said Alice in a soothing tone: ‘don’t be angry
***** it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I ***** you’d
take a fancy to cats if you ***** only see her. She is such a dear quiet
*****,’ Alice went on, half to *******, as she swam ****** ***** in the
pool, ‘and she sits purring so ****** by the fire, ******* her paws and
******* her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to *****--and she’s
such a capital one for cat***** mice--oh, I beg your pardon!’ *****
Alice *****, for this***** the ***** was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be ****** ******ed. ‘We won’t talk about her any
more if you’d ****** not.’

‘We indeed!’ ***** the *****, who was ********* down to the end of his
tail. ‘As if I ***** talk on such a subject! Our ****** ****** HATED
cats: *****, low, ****** *****s! Don’t let me hear the name again!’

‘I won’t ******!’ said Alice, in a great hurry to ****** the ******* of
************. ‘Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?’ The ***** did not
******, so Alice went on *******: ‘***** is such a nice ****** dog near
our ***** I ****** like to show you! A ****** ******-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long ***** ***** hair! And it’ll fetch things when
you ***** them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its ******, and all sorts
of things--I can’t ******** half of them--and it b*****s to a farmer,
you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s ***** a ******* *****s! He
says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!’ ***** Alice in a sorrowful
tone, ‘I’m ****** I’ve offended it again!’ For the ***** was ********
away from her as***** as it ***** go, and ****** ***** a ********* in
the pool as it went.

So she called ****** ***** it, ‘***** dear! Do come back again, and we
won’t talk about cats or dogs ******, if you don’t like them!’ When the
***** ***** this, it turned ***** and swam ****** back to her: its
face was quite pale (with passion, Alice *******), and it said in a low
********* *****, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my
*******, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.’

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite *****ed with the
***** and ******s that had ****** into it: ***** were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an ******, and ******* ***** ******* ********s. Alice led the
way, and the ***** ***** swam to the shore.




******* III. A ******-Race and a***** Tale

They were ****** a *****-******* ***** that ********d on the bank--the
***** with draggled *******s, the ******s with their fur clinging *****
to them, and all ******** wet, *****, and *************.

The ***** ******** of course was, how to get dry *****: they had a
************ ***** this, and ***** a few ******s it seemed ***** *******
to Alice to find ******* ******* ********** with them, as if she had
***** them all her life. ******, she had ***** a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned *****, and ***** only say, ‘I am older than
you, and must know ******’; and this*****e ***** not ***** *******
******* how old it was, and, as the Lory ********** ******d to tell its
age, ***** was no more to be said.

At last the *****, who seemed to be a ****** of authority among them,
*****d out, ‘Sit down, all of you, and ****** to me! I’LL soon make you
dry ******!’ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she ***** ***** a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an ********* air, ‘are you all *****? This
is the driest ***** I know. ******* all *****, if you p*****! “William
the *********, ***** ***** was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the *******, who wanted ******s, and had been of late much
********** to usur*****n and ********. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and *****umbria--“’

‘Ugh!’ said the Lory, with a s*****.

‘I beg your pardon!’ said the Mouse, *****ing, but very politely: ‘Did
you *****?’

‘Not I!’ said the Lory *******.

‘I ******* you did,’ said the Mouse. ‘--I *******. “Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and *****umbria, *******d for him: and even Stigand,
the ********* ********** of Canterbury, ***** it advisable--“’

‘***** WHAT?’ said the Duck.

‘***** IT,’ the ***** replied ****** *******: ‘of course you know what
“it” means.’

‘I know what “it” means well enough, when I find a thing,’ said the
Duck: ‘it’s ********* a frog or a worm. The ******** is, what did the
********** find?’

The ***** did not ****** this question, but *******ly went on, ‘“--*****
it advisable to go with Edgar ******** to meet William and ***** him the
*****. William’s ******* at first was ********. But the ********* of his
******s--” How are you ******* on now, my dear?’ it continued, *******
to Alice as it *****.

‘As wet as*****,’ said Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to
dry me at all.’

‘In that case,’ said the Dodo ********, ****** to its feet, ‘I move
that the ******* *******, for the ********* ******** of more energetic
remedies--’

‘***** *******!’ said the Eaglet. ‘I don’t know the ******* of half
***** long words, and, what’s more, I don’t ******* you do e*****!’ And
the ****** bent down its head to hide a *****: some of the ***** *****
******ed *******.

‘What I was ***** to say,’ said the Dodo in an ******ed tone, ‘was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a ******-race.’

‘What IS a Caucus-race?’ said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
but the Dodo had *****d as if it t*****t that ******** ***** to speak,
and no one else seemed ******** to say anything.

‘Why,’ said the Dodo, ‘the best way to ******* it is to do it.’ (And, as
you ***** like to try the thing yourself, some w***** day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it.)

***** it marked out a race-c*****, in a sort of circle, [‘the *****
***** doesn’t ******,’ it said,) and then all the ***** were placed
***** the ******, here and there. ***** was no ‘One, two, *****, and
away,’ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. *******,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly *****d out ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded
***** it, panting, and ******, ‘But who has won?’

This question the Dodo could not answer ******* a ***** deal of *******,
and it sat for a***** time with one finger *****ed upon its forehead
(the ******** in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
of him), ***** the rest******d in silence. At last the Dodo said,
‘********* has won, and all must***** *****s.’

‘But who is to give the *****s?’ ***** a ****** of voices asked.

‘Why, SHE, of course,’ said the Dodo, ******** to Alice with one finger;
and the ***** ***** at once *****ed ***** her, ******* out in a confused
way, ‘*****s! *****s!’

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
******, and ****** out a box of comfits, (******* the salt water had
not got into it), and ****** them ***** as prizes. ***** was ******* one
a-***** all *****.

‘But she must***** a ***** *******, you know,’ said the Mouse.

‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very *******. ‘What else have you got in
your pocket?’ he went on, ******* to Alice.

‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice *****.

‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded ***** her once more, ***** the Dodo solemnly
*******ed the *******, ****** ‘We beg your acceptance of this *******
*******’; and, when it had ******** this short speech, they all cheered.

Alice ******* the ***** ***** very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to *****; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she ****** bowed, and took the thimble, ******* as solemn as she
*****.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
*********, as the large birds ********ed that they could not taste
*****s, and the ***** ones *****d and had to be patted on the back.
*******, it was over at last, and they sat down ***** in a ring, and
begged the ***** to tell them ********* more.

‘You *******d to tell me your *******, you know,’ said Alice, ‘and why
it is you hate--C and D,’ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
***** be offended *****.

‘Mine is a***** and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse, ******* to Alice, and
*******.

‘It IS a long tail, *********,’ said Alice, ******* down with ****** at
the *****’s tail; ‘but why do you call it sad?’ And she kept on puzzling
***** it while the ***** was ********, so that her idea of the tale was
********* like this:--

         ‘Fury said to a
         *****, That he
        met in the
       *****,
     “Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        *********
         YOU.--Come,
           I’ll take no
           ******; We
          must***** a
        *****: For
      ****** this
     ******* I’ve
    *******
    to do.”
      Said the
      ***** to the
       cur, “Such
        a *****,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       ***** be
      *******
      our
      ******.”
        “I’ll be
        *****, I’ll
         be jury,”
             Said
         *******
          old Fury:
          “I’ll
          try the
            *****
            *****,
              and
           *******
           you
          to
           *****.”’


‘You are not ******ing!’ said the Mouse to Alice ******ly. ‘What are you
******** of?’

‘I beg your pardon,’ said Alice very humbly: ‘you had got to the fifth
bend, I *****?’

‘I had NOT!’ ***** the *****, ******* and very angrily.

‘A knot!’ said Alice, ****** ***** to make ******* ******, and *******
********* ***** her. ‘Oh, do let me help to undo it!’

‘I ***** do nothing of the sort,’ said the Mouse, ******* up and walking
away. ‘You ****** me by ******* such nonsense!’

‘I didn’t mean it!’ *****ed poor Alice. ‘But you’re so ****** ******ed,
you know!’

The ***** only growled in reply.

‘****** come back and ****** your story!’ Alice *****d ***** it; and the
*****s all joined in chorus, ‘Yes, ****** do!’ but the ***** only shook
its head impatiently, and walked a ****** *****er.

‘What a pity it wouldn’t stay!’ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was *****
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
******** ‘Ah, my dear! Let this be a ****** to you never to lose
YOUR temper!’ ‘Hold your ******, Ma!’ said the young Crab, a ******
********ly. ‘You’re enough to try the patience of an ******!’

‘I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!’ said Alice *****, *******ing
****** in p*********. ‘She’d soon fetch it back!’

‘And who is Dinah, if I might ******* to ask the question?’ said the
Lory.

Alice replied *******, for she was ****** ***** to talk ***** her pet:
‘Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for cat***** mice you
can’t *****! And oh, I wish you could see her ***** the *****! Why,
she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!’

This speech *****d a ********** ********* among the *****. Some of the
***** ******* off at once: one old ****** began wrapping itself up very
*********, ******ing, ‘I ****** must be ******* home; the *****-air
doesn’t suit my ******!’ and a ****** *****d out in a trembling voice to
its ********, ‘Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!’
On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left *****.

‘I wish I hadn’t *******ed Dinah!’ she said to ******* in a melancholy
tone. ‘****** seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I ****** if I shall***** see you
any more!’ And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
****** and low-********. In a little *****, *******, she ***** *****
a ****** ******ing of ********s in the distance, and she looked up
*******, half hoping that the ***** had ******d his mind, and was ******
back to ****** his *****.




******* IV. The *****t Sends in a Little Bill

It was the ***** *****t, trotting s***** back again, and *******
********* ***** as it went, as if it had lost something; and she *****
it mut*****g to itself ‘The *******! The *******! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me *******d, as sure as ferrets are
******s! ***** CAN I have dropped them, I ******?’ Alice *****ed in a
****** that it was ******* for the fan and the pair of ***** kid *****s,
and she very good-*******ly began ******* ***** for them, but they were
******* to be seen--********** seemed to have ******d ***** her swim in
the pool, and the ***** hall, with the glass****** and the ****** door,
had ******ed **********.

Very soon the *****t ******d Alice, as she went ******* *****, and
*****d out to her in an ***** tone, ‘Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you *****
out here? Run home this ******, and ***** me a***** of gloves and a fan!
*****, now!’ And Alice was so much ********ed that she ran off at once
in the direction it ******* to, ******* ****** to explain the mistake it
had made.

‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to ******* as she ran. ‘How
********d he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d ****** take him
his fan and *****s--that is, if I can find them.’ As she said this, she
came upon a neat little *****, on the door of which was a b***** *****
***** with the name ‘W. *****T’ ******** upon it. She went in *******
********, and ******* ********, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house ****** she had ***** the
fan and *****s.

‘How ***** it seems,’ Alice said to *******, ‘to be ***** *******s for
a *****t! I ******* Dinah’ll be sending me on *******s next!’ And she
began *****ing the sort of thing that ***** ******: ‘“Miss*****e! Come
here directly, and get ***** for your walk!” “****** in a minute,
*****! But I’ve got to see that the ***** doesn’t get out.” Only I don’t
*****,’ Alice went on, ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it
began ******** ****** ***** like that!’

By this time she had ***** her way into a tidy ****** room with a *****
in the w*****, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny ***** kid *****s: she took up the fan and a pair of the *****s,
and was just going to ***** the room, when her eye fell upon a ******
****** that ***** near the looking-glass. ***** was no label this time
with the words ‘***** ME,’ but ************ she ******ed it and put it
to her lips. ‘I know ********* *********** is sure to happen,’ she said
to herself, ‘******** I eat or drink ********; so I’ll just see what
this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow ***** *****, for ******
I’m ***** ***** of being such a tiny ****** *****!’

It did so ******, and much sooner than she had ******ed: ****** she had
***** half the bottle, she ***** her head pressing ******* the *******,
and had to stoop to save her neck from ***** ******. She ******* put
down the bottle, ****** to herself ‘That’s ***** ******--I hope I shan’t
grow any more--As it is, I can’t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn’t
***** ***** so much!’

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another ****** *****
was not even room for this, and she ***** the ****** of****** down with
one ***** ******* the door, and the ***** arm ****** ***** her head.
***** she went on growing, and, as a last ********, she put one arm out
of the w*****, and one foot up the *******, and said to ******* ‘Now I
can do no more, ******** ******s. What WILL become of me?’

******* for Alice, the ****** ***** ****** had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: ***** it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of c***** of her ever ******* out of the room
*****, no wonder she felt unhappy.

‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ ******* poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t
****** growing *****r and *****er, and ***** *****ed ***** by mice and
*****ts. I ****** wish I hadn’t gone down that *****t-hole--and yet--and
yet--it’s ****** *******, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-*****, I ******* that
kind of ***** ***** ******ed, and now here I am in the middle of one!
***** ***** to be a book written ***** me, that ***** *****! And when I
grow up, I’ll write one--but I’m ***** up now,’ she added in a sorrowful
tone; ‘at least there’s no room to grow up any more HERE.’

‘But then,’ ******* Alice, ‘***** I ***** get any older than I am
now? That’ll be a *******, one way--***** to be an old woman--but
then--****** to have ******s to learn! Oh, I ******n’t like THAT!’

‘Oh, you ******* Alice!’ she ******ed *******. ‘How can you *****
******s in here? Why, *****’s ****** room for YOU, and no room at all
for any ******-books!’

And so she went on, ****** ***** one side and then the *****, and ******
***** a ************ of it **********; but ***** a few ******s she *****
a ***** *******, and ******* to listen.

‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘***** me my *****s this moment!’
Then came a little ******ing of feet on the *****s. Alice knew it was
the *****t ****** to look for her, and she *******d till she shook the
*****, ***** ******ting that she was now ***** a ******** times as large
as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be ****** of it.

********* the *****t came up to the door, and ***** to open it; but, as
the door opened *******, and Alice’s ***** was *****ed hard against it,
that ******* *****d a *******. Alice ***** it say to ****** ‘Then I’ll
go round and get in at the w*****.’

‘THAT you won’t’ ******* Alice, and, ***** ******* till she fancied
she ***** the *****t just under the w*****, she ******ly ****** out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of ********,
but she ***** a ****** ****** and a fall, and a ***** of broken *****,
from ***** she ********d that it was just possible it had ****** into a
********-*****, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice--the *****t’s--‘Pat! Pat! ***** are you?’ And
then a ***** she had ***** ***** ******, ‘Sure then I’m here! *******
for *****s, yer honour!’

‘******* for *****s, ******!’ said the Rabbit *******. ‘Here! Come and
help me out of THIS!’ (*****s of more ****** *****.)

‘Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the w*****?’

‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced it ‘arrum.’)

‘An arm, you *****! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the *****
******!’

‘Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.’

‘Well, it’s got no business *****, at any rate: go and take it away!’

***** was a long silence after this, and Alice ***** only hear *******s
now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you ******!’ and at last she ****** out her
hand again, and made another ****** in the air. This***** ***** were
TWO ****** ******s, and more sounds of broken *****. ‘What a ****** of
********-*****s ***** must be!’ ******* Alice. ‘I ****** what they’ll do
next! As for pulling me out of the w*****, I only wish they COULD! I’m
sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer!’

She waited for some time ******* ******* ******** more: at last came a
******** of little cartwheels, and the ***** of a***** many voices
all ******* ********: she made out the words: ‘*****’s the *****
******?--Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the *****--Bill!
***** it*****, lad!--Here, put ‘em up at this ******--No, tie ‘em
******** *****--they don’t ***** half high ****** yet--Oh! they’ll
do well ******; don’t be particular--Here, Bill! ***** hold of this
rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that ***** *****--Oh, it’s ******
down! Heads *****!’ (a loud crash)--‘Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
*****--Who’s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan’t! YOU do it!--That I
won’t, then!--Bill’s to go down--Here, Bill! the ****** says you’re to
go down the *******!’

‘Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?’ said Alice to
*******. ‘Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I *****n’t be in
Bill’s ***** for a good deal: this fireplace is ******, to be sure; but
I ***** I can kick a ******!’

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she *****, and waited
till she heard a little ****** (she *****n’t ***** of what sort it was)
********** and ********** ***** in the chimney close above her: then,
****** to herself ‘This is Bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
see what ***** ****** next.

The ***** ***** she ***** was a ******* ****** of ‘***** goes Bill!’
then the *****t’s ***** *****--‘***** him, you by the hedge!’ then
*******, and then ******* ********* of voices--‘Hold up his head--******
now--Don’t ***** him--How was it, old ******? What ******ed to you? Tell
us all about it!’

Last came a ****** ******, ******ing voice, [‘That’s Bill,’ *******
Alice,) ‘Well, I ****** know--No more, ***** ye; I’m ****** now--but I’m
a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, ********* ***** at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-******!’

‘So you did, old ******!’ said the others.

‘We must burn the house down!’ said the Rabbit’s *****; and Alice *****d
out as loud as she could, ‘If you do. I’ll set Dinah at you!’

***** was a dead silence instantly, and Alice ******* to herself, ‘I
****** what they WILL do next! If they had any *****, they’d take the
roof off.’ ***** a ****** or two, they began moving ***** *****, and
Alice ***** the *****t say, ‘A ******ful will do, to begin with.’

‘A ******ful of WHAT?’ ******* Alice; but she had not long to *****,
for the next moment a ****** of little ******s came rattling in at the
******, and some of them hit her in the face. ‘I’ll put a stop to this,’
she said to *******, and *****ed out, ‘You’d ****** not do that *****!’
***** *******d ******* dead silence.

Alice ******d with some ******** that the ******s were all turning into
****** cakes as they lay on the floor, and a ****** idea came into her
head. ‘If I eat one of ***** cakes,’ she *******, ‘it’s sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can’t ******** make me *****r, it must
make me *****er, I *******.’

So she s******ed one of the cakes, and was ********* to find that she
began ********* ********. As soon as she was small enough to get *******
the door, she ran out of the house, and ***** ***** a ***** of little
******s and ***** ******* *******. The poor little ******, Bill, was
in the middle, ***** held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
********* out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the ****** she
******ed; but she ran off as***** as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a ***** wood.

‘The ***** ***** I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to herself, as she wandered
***** in the wood, ‘is to grow to my ***** size *****; and the ******
***** is to find my way into that ****** ******. I ***** that will be
the best plan.’

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and ******
*******d; the only difficulty was, that she had not the *****est idea
how to set about it; and ***** she was peering ***** ********* among
the trees, a ****** ***** bark just over her head made her look up in a
***** *****.

An enormous ***** was ******* down at her with large round eyes, and
****** ********** out one paw, ****** to touch her. ‘Poor little *****!’
said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she ***** hard to ******* to it; but
she was terribly f*****ened all the time at the t*****t that it might be
******, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in ***** of
all her coaxing.

****** ******* what she did, she ****** up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; ********* the ***** jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and ****** at the stick,
and made believe to ***** it; then Alice *****d ****** a ***** *******,
to keep ******* from ***** run over; and the ****** she ******ed on the
***** side, the ***** made another rush at the *****, and ******d head
over heels in its ***** to get hold of it; then Alice, ******** it was
very like ****** a game of play with a cart-horse, and ******ing every
****** to be *******d ***** its feet, ran ***** the ******* *****; then
the ***** began a ****** of short charges at the stick, ******* a very
****** way ******** each time and a long way back, and barking ********
all the *****, till at last it sat down a***** way off, panting, with
its ****** ******* out of its mouth, and its ***** eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for ****** her ******; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
till the puppy’s bark sounded ***** ***** in the distance.

‘And yet what a dear little ***** it was!’ said Alice, as she leant
******* a ********* to rest *******, and fanned ******* with one of the
******: ‘I ****** have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I’d
only been the ***** size to do it! Oh dear! I’d ****** ********* that
I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be ******d? I
******* I ***** to eat or ***** ********* or******; but the *****
******** is, what?’

The ***** ******** ********* was, what? Alice looked all ***** her at
the ******s and the *****s of grass, but she did not see ******** that
looked like the ***** ***** to eat or ***** ***** the ************s.
***** was a ***** ******** growing near her, ***** the same h***** as
*******; and when she had looked ***** it, and on both sides of it, and
****** it, it occurred to her that she ***** as***** look and see what
was on the top of it.

She *******ed ******* up on ******, and peeped over the edge of the
********, and her eyes immediately met ***** of a large caterpillar,
that was ******* on the top with its arms folded, ******* ******* a long
******, and ****** not the *****est notice of her or of anything else.




******* V. ****** from a ***********

The *********** and Alice looked at***** ***** for some time in silence:
at last the *********** took the hookah out of its mouth, and *******ed
her in a languid, ****** *****.

‘Who are YOU?’ said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
****** *****, ‘I--I ****** know, sir, just at *******--at least I know
who I WAS when I got up this *******, but I ***** I must***** been
******d ******* times ***** then.’

‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar *******. ‘*******
********!’

‘I can’t ******* ******, I’m ******, sir’ said Alice, ‘******* I’m not
******, you see.’

‘I don’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘I’m ****** I can’t put it more *******,’ Alice replied very politely,
‘for I can’t ********** it myself to begin with; and ***** so many
********* sizes in a day is very confusing.’

‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, ******* you *****’t ***** it so yet,’ said Alice; ‘but when you
have to turn into a *********--you will some day, you know--and then
***** that into a*******fly, I ****** ***** you’ll feel it a little
*****, won’t you?’

‘Not a bit,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, ******* your feelings may be different,’ said Alice; ‘all I know
is, it would feel very queer to ME.’

‘You!’ said the Caterpillar **************. ‘Who are YOU?’

***** brought them back again to the ********* of the conversation.
Alice felt a little ********d at the Caterpillar’s ****** such VERY
***** ******s, and she drew ******* up and said, very g*****y, ‘I *****,
you ***** to tell me who YOU are, *****.’

‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as*****e ***** not ***** of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY **********
***** of mind, she turned away.

‘Come back!’ the *********** *****d ***** her. ‘I’ve something important
to say!’

This sounded *********, *********: Alice turned and came back *****.

‘Keep your ******,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Is that all?’ said Alice, *******ing down her ***** as***** as she
*****.

‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.

Alice ******* she ***** as***** wait, as she had ******* else to do, and
******* ***** all it might tell her ********* ***** *******. For some
******s it puffed away without spe*****, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘So you think
you’re changed, do you?’

‘I’m ****** I am, sir,’ said Alice; ‘I can’t ******** *****s as I
used--and I don’t keep the same size for ten ******s ********!’

‘Can’t ******** WHAT *****s?’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, I’ve tried to say “HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,” but it all came
*********!’ Alice replied in a very ********** *****.

‘******, “YOU ARE OLD, ****** WILLIAM,”’ said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:--

   ‘You are old, ****** William,’ the ***** man said,
    ‘And your hair has ****** very white;
   And yet you *********** ***** on your head--
    Do you think, at your age, it is *****?’

   ‘In my *****,’ ****** William replied to his son,
    ‘I feared it might ****** the *****;
   But, now that I’m ********* sure I have none,
    Why, I do it ***** and *****.’

   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘as I mentioned ******,
    And have grown most ********ly fat;
   Yet you turned a back-somer***** in at the door--
    Pray, what is the reason of that?’

   ‘In my *****,’ said the sage, as he ***** his grey locks,
    ‘I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the use of this ********--one ******** the box--
    ***** me to sell you a couple?’

   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘and your jaws are too weak
    For ******** *****er than suet;
   Yet you ******** the *****, with the bones and the beak--
    Pray how did you ****** to do it?’

   ‘In my *****,’ said his father, ‘I took to the law,
    And *****d each case with my wife;
   And the ******** ********, ***** it gave to my jaw,
    Has *****d the rest of my life.’

   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘one ***** ****** *******
    That your eye was as ****** as*****;
   Yet you *******d an eel on the end of your nose--
    What made you so ******* ******?’

   ‘I have answered ***** ********s, and that is enough,’
    Said his father; ‘don’t give ******** airs!
   Do you think I can ****** all day to such *****?
    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!’


‘That is not said right,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Not ***** *****, I’m ******,’ said Alice, *****ly; ‘some of the *****
have got *****ed.’

‘It is ***** from ********* to end,’ said the Caterpillar *********, and
***** was ******* for some minutes.

The *********** was the ***** to speak.

‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.

‘Oh, I’m not ********** as to size,’ Alice ******* replied; ‘only one
doesn’t like ******** so often, you know.’

‘I DON’T know,’ said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had ***** been so much contradicted in her life
******, and she felt that she was ****** her ******.

‘Are you ******* now?’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, I ****** like to be a ****** *****r, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,’
said Alice: ‘***** inches is such a wretched ****** to be.’

‘It is a very good ****** ******!’ said the Caterpillar *******, rearing
****** ******* as it ***** (it was ******* ***** inches high).

‘But I’m not used to it!’ *****ed poor Alice in a piteous*****. And
she ******* of herself, ‘I wish the creatures *****n’t be so ******
******ed!’

‘You’ll get used to it in time,’ said the Caterpillar; and it put the
****** into its mouth and began smoking again.

This***** Alice waited ********* ***** it chose to ***** *****. In
a ****** or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
and yawned once or *****, and ***** ******. Then it got down off the
********, and *****ed away in the *****, ****** ******ing as it went,
‘One side will make you grow taller, and the ***** side will make you
grow *****er.’

‘One side of WHAT? The ***** side of WHAT?’ ******* Alice to herself.

‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
*****; and in another ****** it was out of sight.

Alice ******ed ******* **********ly at the mushroom for a minute, ******
to make out ***** were the two sides of it; and as it was *********
*****, she ***** this a very ********* ********. *******, at last she
*******ed her arms ***** it as far as they ***** go, and ***** off a bit
of the edge with each hand.

‘And now ***** is which?’ she said to *******, and ******d a ****** of
the *****-hand bit to try the ******: the next moment she felt a violent
blow ********** her chin: it had ****** her foot!

She was a good deal ********ed by this very sudden ******, but she felt
that ***** was no time to be lost, as she was sh******* *******; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was *****ed
so closely against her foot, that ***** was ****** room to open her
*****; but she did it at last, and ******d to s****** a ****** of the
lefthand bit.


  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

‘Come, my head’s free at last!’ said Alice in a***** of delight, *****
******d into alarm in another ******, when she ***** that her ********s
were nowhere to be found: all she ***** see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, ***** seemed to rise like a ***** out of a
sea of green l***** that lay far ***** her.

‘What CAN all that ***** ***** be?’ said Alice. ‘And ***** HAVE my
********s got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?’
She was ****** them ***** as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
****** a ****** shaking among the ******* ***** ******.

As there seemed to be no chance of g*****g her hands up to her head, she
***** to get her head down to them, and was ********* to find that her
neck would bend ***** ****** in any direction, like a *******. She had
just succeeded in curving it down into a ******** ******, and was *****
to dive in among the leaves, ***** she ***** to be ******* but the tops
of the trees****** ***** she had been wandering, when a ***** hiss made
her draw back in a *****: a ***** ****** had ***** into her face, and
was ******* her ********* with its*****s.

‘*******!’ ******ed the ******.

‘I’m NOT a *******!’ said Alice ***********. ‘Let me alone!’

‘*******, I say *****!’ ******ed the ******, but in a more ******* tone,
and added with a kind of sob, ‘I’ve tried every way, and ******* seems
to suit them!’

‘I *****’t the ***** idea what you’re talking about,’ said Alice.

‘I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried
*****s,’ the ****** went on, ******* ******ing to her; ‘but *****
*******s! *****’s no pleasing them!’

Alice was more and more ******d, but she ******* ***** was no use in
****** ******** more till the ****** had ********.

‘As if it wasn’t ******* ****** ******** the eggs,’ said the Pigeon;
‘but I must be on the look-out for *******s ***** and day! Why, I
*****’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!’

‘I’m very sorry you’ve been *****ed,’ said Alice, who was ********* to
see its *******.

‘And just as I’d ***** the highest tree in the wood,’ ********* the
******, ******* its ***** to a shriek, ‘and just as I was ******** I
****** be free of them at last, they must ***** come wriggling down from
the sky! Ugh, *******!’

‘But I’m NOT a *******, I tell you!’ said Alice. ‘I’m a--I’m a--’

‘Well! WHAT are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can see you’re t***** to
****** *********!’

‘I--I’m a ****** girl,’ said Alice, ****** **********, as she rem*****ed
the ****** of changes she had gone t****** that day.

‘A ****** ***** ******!’ said the Pigeon in a***** of the deepest
********. ‘I’ve seen a good many ****** girls in my time, but ***** ONE
with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and *****’s no use
denying it. I ******* you’ll be ******* me next that you ***** *****d an
egg!’

‘I HAVE tasted eggs, *********,’ said Alice, who was a very truthful
*****; ‘but ****** girls eat eggs ***** as much as serpents do, you
know.’

‘I don’t ******* it,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but if they do, why then they’re
a kind of *******, that’s all I can say.’

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was ***** ****** for a
****** or two, ***** gave the Pigeon the *********** of adding, ‘You’re
******* for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it ****** to me
******* you’re a little girl or a *******?’

‘It matters a***** deal to ME,’ said Alice *******; ‘but I’m not *******
for eggs, as it ******s; and if I was, I ******n’t want YOURS: I don’t
like them raw.’

‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it ******d
down again into its nest. Alice ******** down among the trees as well as
she *****, for her neck kept ******* ********d among the ******es, and
***** now and then she had to stop and ******* it. ***** a ***** she
********ed that she ***** held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
*****, and growing ********* taller and ********* *****er, ***** she had
*******ed in b******* ******* down to her ***** ******.

It was so long ***** she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite ******* at first; but she got used to it in a few ******s,
and began ******* to herself, as usual. ‘Come, *****’s half my plan done
now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m ***** sure what I’m *****
to be, from one ****** to another! *******, I’ve got back to my right
size: the next thing is, to get into that ********* ******--how IS that
to be done, I ******?’ As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
*****, with a little ***** in it ***** four feet high. ‘******* *****
*****,’ ******* Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
I ****** ******** them out of their wits!’ So she began nibbling at the
*****hand bit *****, and did not ******* to go near the house till she
had brought ******* down to nine inches high.




******* VI. Pig and ******

For a ****** or two she stood looking at the *****, and ******ing what
to do next, when ******ly a ******* in livery came running out of the
wood--(she ********ed him to be a ******* ******* he was in ******:
*********, judging by his face only, she ***** have called him a
fish)--and ****** ****** at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
by another ******* in livery, with a****** face, and ***** eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice ******d, had ******** hair that ****** all
over their heads. She felt very ******* to know what it was all *****,
and ***** a ****** way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from ***** his arm a ***** ******,
****** as large as *******, and this he ****** over to the *****,
******, in a solemn tone, ‘For the *******. An invitation from the *****
to play *******.’ The Frog-******* ******ed, in the same ****** tone,
only changing the ***** of the words a ******, ‘From the *****. An
********** for the ******* to play *******.’

Then they both bowed low, and ***** curls got ********d ********.

Alice *****ed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the ***** was ******* on the ground near the
door, staring ******ly up***** the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and *****ed.

‘*****’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the Footman, ‘and that for
two ******s. *****, ******* I’m on the same side of the door as you
are; ********, ******* they’re making such a noise ******, no one could
******** hear you.’ And ********* ***** was a most extraordinary noise
***** on within--a ******** howling and ********, and ***** now and then
a ***** *****, as if a dish or ****** had been broken to pieces.

‘******, then,’ said Alice, ‘how am I to get in?’

‘***** ***** be some ***** in your ********,’ the ******* went on
******* ******ing to her, ‘if we had the door b*****n us. For ********,
if you were ******, you ***** *****, and I ***** let you out, you know.’
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was s*******, and this
Alice ******* ********* *******. ‘But ******* he can’t help it,’ she
said to *******; ‘his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
But at any rate he might ****** ********s.--How am I to get in?’ she
******ed, *****.

‘I ***** sit here,’ the ******* ******ed, ‘till tomorrow--’

At this ****** the door of the ***** opened, and a ***** ***** came
******** out, ******** at the Footman’s head: it just *****d his nose,
and ***** to pieces ******* one of the trees behind him.

‘--or next day, *****,’ the ******* ********* in the same tone, *******
as if ******* had ******ed.

‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice *****, in a*****er tone.

‘ARE you to get in at all?’ said the Footman. ‘That’s the *****
********, you know.’

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. ‘It’s ******
********,’ she ******ed to herself, ‘the way all the ********s *****.
It’s ****** to drive one *****!’

The ******* seemed to think this a***** *********** for ********* his
******, with var******s. ‘I ***** sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for
days and days.’

‘But what am I to do?’ said Alice.

‘******** you like,’ said the Footman, and began *********.

‘Oh, *****’s no use in talking to him,’ said Alice ***********: ‘he’s
********* *****ic!’ And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, ***** was full of ***** from
one end to the other: the ******* was ******* on a three-legged ***** in
the ******, ******* a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, ********
a ***** cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

‘*****’s ********* too much pepper in that soup!’ Alice said to *******,
as***** as she could for sneezing.

***** was ********* too much of it in the air. Even the *******
******d ************; and as for the baby, it was ******** and howling
*********** ******* a ******’s *****. The only things in the kitchen
that did not ******, were the cook, and a ***** cat ***** was ******* on
the ****** and grinning from ear to ear.

‘****** ***** you tell me,’ said Alice, a ****** *****ly, for she was
not ***** sure ******* it was good manners for her to speak first, ‘why
your cat grins like that?’

‘It’s a Cheshire cat,’ said the Duchess, ‘and that’s why. Pig!’

She said the last word with such sudden ******** that Alice *****
jumped; but she saw in another ****** that it was *******ed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took *******, and went on *****:--

‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know
that cats COULD grin.’

‘They all can,’ said the Duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’

‘I don’t know of any that do,’ Alice said very ********, ******* *****
******* to have got into a conversation.

‘You don’t know much,’ said the Duchess; ‘and that’s a fact.’

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and ******* it would
be as well to ********* some other ******* of conversation. ***** she
was ****** to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work ******** ********** ****** her ***** at
the ******* and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then ******ed a
****** of saucepans, *****s, and dishes. The ******* took no ****** of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was ***** ********** to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

‘Oh, ****** mind what you’re doing!’ ***** Alice, ******* up and down in
an agony of ******. ‘Oh, ***** goes his PRECIOUS nose’; as an *******ly
***** ******** flew ***** by it, and very nearly carried it off.

‘If******body ****** ***** own ********,’ the ******* said in a ******
*****, ‘the ***** ***** go round a deal ****** than it does.’

‘***** ***** NOT be an *********,’ said Alice, who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘Just think of
what work it ***** make with the day and *****! You see the ***** takes
******-four hours to turn round on its axis--’

‘******* of axes,’ said the Duchess, ‘chop off her head!’

Alice ******d ****** ********* at the cook, to see if she ***** to take
the hint; but the cook was busily ******** the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: ‘******-four hours, I *****; or is
it twelve? I--’

‘Oh, don’t ****** ME,’ said the Duchess; ‘I ***** ***** ***** ******s!’
And with that she began ******* her ***** *****, ******* a sort of
******* to it as she did so, and ****** it a violent shake at the end of
***** line:

   ‘***** ******* to your ****** boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
   He only does it to annoy,
    ******* he knows it *****s.’

         ******.

 (In which the cook and the baby joined):--

       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’

***** the ******* sang the second ***** of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little ***** howled so,
that Alice ***** ****** hear the words:--

   ‘I ***** ******ly to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
   For he can thoroughly *****
    The ****** when he p*****s!’

         ******.

       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’

‘Here! you may ***** it a bit, if you like!’ the ******* said to Alice,
*****ing the baby at her as she spoke. ‘I must go and get ***** to play
******* with the Queen,’ and she ******* out of the room. The cook threw
a ******-pan ***** her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice ****** the baby with some difficulty, as it was a *****-*****d
****** ********, and held out its arms and legs in all *********s, ‘just
like a star-fish,’ ******* Alice. The poor little ***** was *****ing
like a *****-****** when she ****** it, and kept doubling ****** up and
**********ing itself out *****, so that **********, for the ***** ******
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (***** was to
***** it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its *****
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
it out***** the open air. ‘IF I don’t take this ***** away with me,’
******* Alice, ‘they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: *****n’t it be
****** to leave it ******?’ She said the last ***** out loud, and the
****** ***** *****ed in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
‘Don’t *****,’ said Alice; ‘that’s not at all a proper way of expressing
********.’

The baby grunted *****, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
see what was the ****** with it. ***** ***** be no ***** that it had
a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a ***** than a real nose; also its
eyes were ******* ********* ***** for a baby: ********** Alice did not
like the look of the ***** at all. ‘But ******* it was only sobbing,’
she *******, and looked into its eyes *****, to see if ***** were any
tears.

No, ***** were no tears. ‘If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,’
said Alice, *******ly, ‘I’ll have ******* more to do with you. Mind
now!’ The poor little ***** sobbed again (or grunted, it was **********
to say which), and they went on for some ***** in silence.

Alice was just beginning to ***** to herself, ‘Now, what am I to do with
this creature when I get it home?’ when it grunted *****, so violently,
that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This***** ***** *****
be NO ******* ***** it: it was ******* more nor less than a pig, and she
felt that it would be ***** ****** for her to carry it *******.

So she set the little ******** down, and felt quite *******d to see
it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘If it had ***** up,’ she said
to herself, ‘it would have made a******fully ugly *****: but it makes
****** a ******** pig, I *****.’ And she began ******** over******
******** she knew, who ***** do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, ‘if one only knew the ***** way to change them--’ when she
was a ****** *******d by seeing the Cheshire Cat ******* on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
*******: ***** it had VERY long claws and a ***** many teeth, so she
felt that it*****t to be *****ed with respect.

‘Cheshire Puss,’ she began, ****** *****ly, as she did not at all know
******* it would like the name: *******, it only grinned a ****** wider.
‘Come, it’s ******* so far,’ ******* Alice, and she went on. ‘***** you
tell me, ******, ***** way I ***** to go from here?’

‘That ******s a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.

‘I don’t much care *****--’ said Alice.

‘Then it doesn’t ****** ***** way you go,’ said the Cat.

‘--so long as I get *********,’ Alice added as an ***********.

‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if you only walk long
******.’

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another ********.
‘What sort of ****** live ***** here?’

‘In THAT *********,’ the Cat said, waving its right paw *****, ‘*****
a ******: and in THAT *********,’ waving the other paw, ‘***** a *****
Hare. ***** ****** you like: they’re both mad.’

‘But I don’t want to go among mad ******,’ Alice ******ed.

‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here. I’m mad.
You’re mad.’

‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.

‘You must be,’ said the Cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have come here.’

Alice didn’t ***** that *****d it at all; *******, she went on ‘And how
do you know that you’re mad?’

‘To begin with,’ said the Cat, ‘a dog’s not mad. You ***** that?’

‘I ******* so,’ said Alice.

‘Well, then,’ the Cat went on, ‘you see, a dog *****s when it’s *****,
and wags its***** when it’s *******. Now I ***** when I’m *******, and
wag my tail when I’m *****. ********* I’m mad.’

‘I call it purring, not *****ing,’ said Alice.

‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat. ‘Do you***** ******* with the
***** to-day?’

‘I ****** like it very much,’ said Alice, ‘but I *****’t been invited
yet.’

‘You’ll see me *****,’ said the Cat, and ******ed.

Alice was not much sur*****d at this, she was ******* so used to queer
*****s ******ing. ***** she was ******* at the place where it had been,
it suddenly ******ed *****.

‘By-the-bye, what ****** of the baby?’ said the Cat. ‘I’d ******
********* to ask.’

‘It turned into a pig,’ Alice ******* said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

‘I ******* it would,’ said the Cat, and ******ed *****.

Alice waited a ******, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
******, and ***** a ****** or two she walked on in the ********* in
***** the ***** Hare was said to*****. ‘I’ve seen ******s ******,’ she
said to *******; ‘the ***** Hare will be much the most interesting, and
******* as this is May it won’t be raving mad--at least not so mad as
it was in March.’ As she said this, she looked up, and ***** was the Cat
*****, ******* on a branch of a tree.

‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.

‘I said pig,’ replied Alice; ‘and I wish you wouldn’t keep app****** and
********* so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.’

‘All *****,’ said the Cat; and this***** it vanished ***** ******,
********* with the end of the tail, and ****** with the grin, *****
******ed some time ***** the rest of it had gone.

‘Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a*****,’ ******* Alice; ‘but a grin
******* a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!’

She had not gone much ******* ****** she came in ***** of the house
of the March Hare: she ******* it must be the right *****, ******* the
*******s were shaped like ears and the roof was ******ed with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
******d some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and ****** ******* to
***** two feet*****: even then she walked up towards it rather *****ly,
****** to herself ‘******* it should be raving mad ***** all! I ******
wish I’d gone to see the ****** *******!’




******* VII. A Mad Tea-*****

***** was a ***** set out ***** a tree in ***** of the house, and the
***** Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a ******** was *******
******* them, fast asleep, and the ***** two were using it as a
*******, ******* ***** *****s on it, and ******* over its head. ‘Very
************* for the ********,’ ******* Alice; ‘only, as it’s ******, I
******* it doesn’t mind.’

The ***** was a ***** one, but the ***** were all crowded ******** at
one ****** of it: ‘No room! No room!’ they cried out when they saw Alice
******. ‘*****’s ****** of room!’ said Alice ***********, and she sat
down in a ***** arm-***** at one end of the *****.

‘Have some wine,’ the ***** Hare said in an *********** tone.

Alice looked all ***** the *****, but ***** was ******* on it but tea.
‘I don’t see any wine,’ she ******ed.

‘***** isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.

‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice *******.

‘It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down ******* ***** ******d,’ said
the ***** Hare.

‘I didn’t know it was YOUR table,’ said Alice; ‘it’s laid for a great
many more than *****.’

‘Your hair wants *******,’ said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his ***** ******.

‘You ****** ***** not to make ******** ******s,’ Alice said with some
********; ‘it’s very rude.’

The ****** opened his eyes very wide on h****** this; but all he SAID
was, ‘Why is a raven like a w******-desk?’

‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ ******* Alice. ‘I’m glad they’ve
***** ****** ******s.--I ******* I can ***** that,’ she added *****.

‘Do you mean that you ***** you can find out the answer to it?’ said the
***** Hare.

‘******* so,’ said Alice.

‘Then you ****** say what you mean,’ the ***** Hare went on.

‘I do,’ Alice ******* replied; ‘at least--at least I mean what I
say--that’s the same thing, you know.’

‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said the Hatter. ‘You ***** just as well say
that “I see what I eat” is the same ***** as “I eat what I see”!’

‘You ***** just as well say,’ added the ***** Hare, ‘that “I like what I
get” is the same ***** as “I get what I like”!’

‘You ***** just as well say,’ added the ********, who seemed to be
******* in his sleep, ‘that “I ******* when I *****” is the same *****
as “I ***** when I *******”!’

‘It IS the same thing with you,’ said the Hatter, and here the
************ dropped, and the ***** sat ****** for a ******, ***** Alice
******* over all she could rem***** ***** *****s and *******-desks,
***** wasn’t much.

The ****** was the ***** to break the silence. ‘What day of the month
is it?’ he said, ******* to Alice: he had ***** his ***** out of his
******, and was ******* at it ********, shaking it every now and then,
and ******* it to his ear.

Alice ********ed a ******, and then said ‘The ******.’

‘Two days wrong!’ sighed the ******. ‘I told you butter *****n’t suit
the works!’ he added ******* ******* at the March Hare.

‘It was the BEST b*****,’ the ***** Hare meekly replied.

‘Yes, but some crumbs must***** got in as well,’ the ****** *******d:
‘you ******n’t have put it in with the *****-*****.’

The ***** Hare took the ***** and looked at it ********: then he dipped
it***** his cup of tea, and looked at it *****: but he could think of
******* ****** to say than his ***** ******, ‘It was the BEST b*****,
you know.’

Alice had been looking over his ******** with some *********. ‘What a
***** *****!’ she ******ed. ‘It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t
tell what o’***** it is!’

‘Why ****** it?’ ******ed the ******. ‘Does YOUR ***** tell you what
year it is?’

‘Of course not,’ Alice replied very readily: ‘but that’s ******* it
stays the same year for such a***** time ********.’

‘***** is just the case with MINE,’ said the Hatter.

Alice felt dread***** ******d. The ******’s ****** seemed to have no
sort of ******* in it, and yet it was ********* *******. ‘I don’t *****
********** you,’ she said, as politely as she could.

‘The ******** is asleep *****,’ said the Hatter, and he p***** a ******
hot tea upon its nose.

The ******** ***** its head impatiently, and said, ******* ******* its
eyes, ‘Of course, of course; just what I was ***** to remark ******.’

‘Have you g*****d the ****** yet?’ the ****** said, ******* to Alice
*****.

‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied: ‘what’s the ******?’

‘I *****’t the ******est idea,’ said the Hatter.

‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.

Alice sighed *******. ‘I ***** you ***** do something better with the
time,’ she said, ‘than ***** it in ****** ******s that have no ******s.’

‘If you knew Time as***** as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you *****n’t talk
***** ******* IT. It’s HIM.’

‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.

‘Of course you don’t!’ the ****** said, ******* his head con*****uously.
‘I dare say you never even ***** to Time!’

‘******* not,’ Alice ********** replied: ‘but I know I have to beat time
when I ***** *****.’

‘Ah! that *******s for it,’ said the Hatter. ‘He won’t ***** *******.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost ********
you liked with the clock. For ********, ******* it were nine o’***** in
the *******, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and ***** goes the clock in a *********! Half-past one,
time for ******!’

[‘I only wish it was,’ the ***** Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

‘That ***** be grand, *********,’ said Alice **********ly: ‘but then--I
******n’t be hungry for it, you know.’

‘Not at first, *******,’ said the Hatter: ‘but you ***** keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.’

‘Is that the way YOU ******?’ Alice asked.

The ****** ***** his head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ he replied. ‘We
*******led last *****--just before HE went mad, you know--’ (********
with his tea spoon at the ***** Hare,) ‘--it was at the great concert
***** by the Queen of *****s, and I had to sing

     “*******, *******, ****** bat!
     How I ****** what you’re at!”

You know the song, *******?’

‘I’ve heard something***** it,’ said Alice.

‘It goes on, you know,’ the ****** *********, ‘in this way:--

     “Up above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.
         *******, *******--“’

Here the Dor***** ***** ******, and began ******* in its sleep ‘*******,
*******, *******, *******--’ and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop.

‘Well, I’d ****** ******** the ***** *****,’ said the Hatter, ‘when the
***** jumped up and bawled out, “He’s ******ing the time! Off with his
head!”’

‘How ********** ******!’ *******ed Alice.

‘And ever since that,’ the ****** went on in a*****nful tone, ‘he won’t
do a thing I ask! It’s ****** six o’***** now.’

A ****** idea came into Alice’s head. ‘Is that the ****** so many
tea-*****s are put out here?’ she asked.

‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Hatter with a sigh: ‘it’s ****** tea-time,
and we’ve no time to wash the *****s ******* ******.’

‘Then you keep moving *****, I *******?’ said Alice.

‘******* so,’ said the Hatter: ‘as the things get used up.’

‘But what ******s when you come to the ********* *****?’ Alice *******d
to ask.

‘******* we change the *******,’ the ***** Hare interrupted, yawning.
‘I’m ******* ***** of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.’

‘I’m ****** I don’t know one,’ said Alice, ****** ******* at the
********.

‘Then the ******** *****!’ they both *****. ‘Wake up, ********!’ And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The ******** ****** opened his eyes. ‘I wasn’t ******,’ he said in a
******, ****** *****: ‘I ***** ***** word you fellows were ******.’

‘Tell us a *****!’ said the March Hare.

‘Yes, ****** do!’ *****ed Alice.

‘And be quick ***** it,’ added the ******, ‘or you’ll be ****** *****
****** it’s done.’

‘Once upon a time ***** were three little ******s,’ the ******** began
in a great hurry; ‘and ***** names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the ****** of a well--’

‘What did they live on?’ said Alice, who ****** took a great interest in
********s of eating and ********.

‘They lived on *******,’ said the Dor*****, ***** ******** a ****** or
two.

‘They couldn’t have done that, you know,’ Alice ****** ******ed; ‘they’d
have been ill.’

‘So they were,’ said the Dor*****; ‘VERY ill.’

Alice ***** to fancy to ******* what such an ************* ways of
****** ***** be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: ‘But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?’

‘Take some more tea,’ the ***** Hare said to Alice, very*****estly.

‘I’ve had ******* yet,’ Alice replied in an ******ed tone, ‘so I can’t
take more.’

‘You mean you can’t take LESS,’ said the Hatter: ‘it’s very easy to take
MORE than *******.’

‘****** asked YOUR opinion,’ said Alice.

‘Who’s ****** ******** ******s now?’ the ****** asked ************.

Alice did not ***** know what to say to this: so she helped *******
to some tea and *****-and-******, and then turned to the Dor*****, and
******ed her ********. ‘Why did they live at the bottom of a well?’

The ******** ***** took a minute or two to ***** ***** it, and then
said, ‘It was a *******-well.’

‘*****’s no such *****!’ Alice was ********* very angrily, but the
****** and the ***** Hare went ‘Sh! sh!’ and the ******** *******
******ed, ‘If you can’t be civil, you’d ****** ****** the ***** for
********.’

‘No, ****** go on!’ Alice said very ******; ‘I won’t ********* *****. I
dare say there may be ONE.’

‘One, ******!’ said the Dor***** ***********. *******, he consented to
go on. ‘And so these three little ******s--they were ******** to draw,
you know--’

‘What did they draw?’ said Alice, ***** ******ting her *******.

‘*******,’ said the Dor*****, ******* ********ing at all this*****.

‘I want a clean cup,’ *********** the ******: ‘let’s all move one place
on.’

He*****d on as he spoke, and the ******** ******ed him: the ***** Hare
moved into the Dor*****’s *****, and Alice ****** *********ly took
the ***** of the March Hare. The ****** was the only one who got any
********* from the ******: and Alice was a good deal ***** off than
******, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to ****** the ******** *****, so she began very
**********: ‘But I don’t **********. ***** did they draw the *******
from?’

‘You can draw ***** out of a water-well,’ said the Hatter; ‘so I should
***** you ***** draw ******* out of a treacle-well--eh, ******?’

‘But they were IN the well,’ Alice said to the ********, not choosing to
****** this last ******.

‘Of course they were’, said the Dor*****; ‘--well in.’

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the ******** go on for
some time ******* *********ing it.

‘They were ******** to draw,’ the ******** went on, yawning and *******
its eyes, for it was ******* very sleepy; ‘and they drew all ****** of
*****s--********** that *****s with an M--’

‘Why with an M?’ said Alice.

‘Why not?’ said the March Hare.

Alice was ******.

The ******** had *****d its eyes by this*****, and was ***** off into
a doze; but, on being p****** by the Hatter, it woke up again with
a ****** ******, and went on: ‘--that *****s with an M, such as
*****-*****, and the moon, and ******, and ********--you know you say
*****s are “much of a ********”--did you ever see such a ***** as a
******* of a muchness?’

‘******, now you ask me,’ said Alice, very much *******d, ‘I don’t
*****--’

‘Then you ******n’t talk,’ said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice ***** bear: she got up in
***** *******, and walked off; the ******** fell asleep *********, and
******* of the others took the least notice of her going, ****** she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call ***** her:
the last time she saw them, they were ****** to put the Dor***** into
the ******.

‘At any rate I’ll never go ***** *****!’ said Alice as she picked her
way ******* the wood. ‘It’s the ******est tea*****y I ever was at in all
my life!’

Just as she said this, she ******d that one of the trees had a door
******* ***** into it. ‘That’s very curious!’ she *******. ‘But
**********’s ******* today. I ***** I may as***** go in at once.’ And in
she went.

Once more she ***** ******* in the***** hall, and ***** to the little
***** *****. ‘Now, I’ll manage ****** this*****,’ she said to *******,
and began by taking the ****** ****** key, and ******ing the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a****** of it in her pocket) till she was about a***** high:
then she walked down the little *******: and THEN--she ***** ******* at
last in the ********* ******, among the ****** ******-beds and the cool
********s.




******* VIII. The *****’s *******-******

A ***** rose-tree ***** near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but ***** were three gardeners at it, ******
******** them red. Alice ******* this a very ******* *****, and she went
nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she ***** one of
them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Don’t go s*****ing paint over me like
that!’

‘I *****n’t help it,’ said Five, in a sulky tone; ‘***** jogged my
*****.’

On which Seven looked up and said, ‘That’s *****, Five! ****** lay the
***** on******s!’

‘YOU’D ****** not talk!’ said Five. ‘I ***** the ***** say only
********* you *******d to be ******ed!’

‘What for?’ said the one who had ****** *****.

‘That’s none of YOUR business, Two!’ said Seven.

‘Yes, it IS his ********!’ said Five, ‘and I’ll tell him--it was for
*****ing the cook *****-roots ******* of onions.’

***** ***** down his brush, and had just begun ‘Well, of all the unjust
*****s--’ when his eye ******d to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked ******* ******ly: the *****s looked ***** also, and
all of them bowed low.

‘***** you tell me,’ said Alice, a ****** *****ly, ‘why you are ********
***** roses?’

Five and ***** said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
*****, ‘Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ***** to have been a
RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by *******; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, ***** she *****, to--’ At this
****** Five, who had been anxiously looking across the ******, *****d
out ‘The *****! The *****!’ and the ***** ********s ********* *****
********** flat upon their faces. ***** was a ***** of many ********s,
and Alice looked *****, ***** to see the Queen.

***** came ten *******s ******** clubs; ***** were all shaped like
the ***** ********s, ****** and flat, with their hands and feet at the
******s: next the ten ********s; ***** were ornamented all over with
*******s, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. ***** ***** came
the ***** ********; ***** were ten of them, and the ****** dears came
******* ******* ***** hand in hand, in couples: they were all ********ed
with hearts. Next came the *****s, ****** Kings and *****s, and among
them Alice recognised the White *****t: it was ******* in a hurried
******* ******, smiling at everything that was said, and went by *******
noticing her. Then ******ed the ***** of Hearts, ******** the King’s
***** on a crimson velvet *******; and, last of all this grand
**********, came THE***** AND ***** OF HEARTS.

Alice was ****** ******** ******* she ***** not to lie down on her face
like the ***** ********s, but she ***** not ******** ever having *****
of such a rule at processions; ‘and *******, what ***** be the use of
a **********,’ ******* she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the ********** came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the ***** said severely ‘Who is this?’ She said it to the
***** of Hearts, who only bowed and *****d in reply.

‘*****!’ said the Queen, ******* her head impatiently; and, ******* to
Alice, she went on, ‘What’s your name, *****?’

‘My name is*****e, so p***** your Majesty,’ said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, ‘Why, they’re only a pack of cards, *****
all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’

‘And who are *****?’ said the Queen, ******** to the three gardeners who
were lying****** the *****ree; for, you see, as they were lying on *****
faces, and the ******* on their backs was the same as the rest of the
pack, she ***** not tell whether they were ********s, or soldiers, or
********s, or three of her own children.

‘How ****** I know?’ said Alice, ********d at her own *******. ‘It’s no
******** of MINE.’

The ***** turned ******* with fury, and, ***** ******* at her for a
****** like a wild beast, ******ed ‘Off with her head! Off--’

‘********!’ said Alice, very loudly and *********, and the ***** was
******.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and *****ly said ‘********, my
dear: she is only a *****!’

The ***** turned ******* away from him, and said to the ***** ‘Turn them
over!’

The ***** did so, very carefully, with one foot.

‘Get up!’ said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the *****
********s ********* jumped up, and began ****** to the*****, the *****,
the ***** ********, and ********* else.

‘***** off that!’ ******ed the *****. ‘You make me *****.’ And then,
******* to the*****-tree, she went on, ‘What HAVE you been ***** here?’

‘May it p***** your Majesty,’ said Two, in a very ****** tone, *****
down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we were ******--’

‘I see!’ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the*****s.
‘Off with their heads!’ and the ********** moved on, ***** of the
*******s ******ing behind to execute the *********** ********s, who ran
to Alice for **********.

‘You shan’t be beheaded!’ said Alice, and she put them into a large
******-pot that ***** near. The ***** *******s ******ed ***** for a
****** or two, ******* for them, and then ******* *****ed off ***** the
*****s.

‘Are ***** heads off?’ *****ed the *****.

‘***** heads are gone, if it ****** your Majesty!’ the *******s *****ed
in reply.

‘That’s *****!’ *****ed the *****. ‘Can you play c******?’

The *******s were s*****, and looked at Alice, as the question was
********* ***** for her.

‘Yes!’ *****ed Alice.

‘Come on, then!’ roared the *****, and Alice joined the **********,
******ing very much what ***** ****** next.

‘It’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid ***** at her side. She was
******* by the White *****t, who was peeping ********* into her face.

‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘--*****’s the *******?’

‘Hush! Hush!’ said the Rabbit in a low, ******* tone. He looked
********* over his shoulder as he *****, and then ****** ******* upon
******, put his ***** ***** to her ear, and *******ed ‘She’s *****
******** of execution.’

‘What for?’ said Alice.

‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the *****t asked.

‘No, I didn’t,’ said Alice: ‘I don’t ***** it’s at all a pity. I said
“What for?”’

‘She boxed the *****’s ears--’ the *****t began. Alice gave a little
****** of laughter. ‘Oh, hush!’ the *****t *******ed in a f*****ened
tone. ‘The ***** will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
***** said--’

‘Get to your *****s!’ *****ed the ***** in a voice of thunder, and
****** began ******* ***** in all directions, ******** up against each
*****; *******, they got ******d down in a ****** or two, and the game
began. Alice ******* she had ***** seen such a ******* *******-****** in
her life; it was all *****s and ******s; the balls were live ********s,
the ******s live ********es, and the *******s had to double **********
up and to ***** on their hands and feet, to make the ******.

The ***** ********** Alice ***** at first was in managing her ********:
she *******ed in getting its body tucked away, *********** ******, *****
her arm, with its legs ******* down, but *********, just as she had got
its neck nicely **********ed out, and was ***** to***** the ******** a
blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself ***** and look up in her face,
with such a ******d ********** that she ***** not help bursting out
********: and when she had got its head down, and was ***** to begin
*****, it was very provoking to find that the ******** had ******ed
******, and was in the act of *****ing away: ******* all this, ***** was
********* a ***** or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
******** to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always ******* up
and ******* off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
********** that it was a very difficult game ******.

The ******s all played at once without w****** for turns, *******ling
all the *****, and ******** for the ********s; and in a very *****
time the ***** was in a furious passion, and went stamping *****, and
*****ing ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ ***** once in a
******.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
******* with the Queen, but she knew that it might ****** any ******,
‘and then,’ ******* she, ‘what ***** ****** of me? They’re dread*****
fond of ******ing people here; the ***** ****** is, that *****’s any one
left alive!’

She was ******* ***** for some way of ******, and ******ing w****** she
***** get away without being seen, when she ******d a ******* **********
in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, ***** *****ing it
a ****** or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to *******
‘It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I ***** have somebody to talk to.’

‘How are you ******* on?’ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
****** for it to ***** with.

Alice waited till the eyes ******ed, and then nodded. ‘It’s no use
******** to it,’ she *******, ‘till its ears have come, or at ***** one
of them.’ In another ****** the ***** head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, ******* very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that ***** was
****** of it now in sight, and no more of it ******ed.

‘I don’t ***** they play at all fairly,’ Alice began, in rather a
********ing tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dread***** one can’t hear
******* *****--and they don’t seem to have any rules in **********;
at least, if there are, ****** ******s to them--and you’ve no idea how
******ing it is all the things ***** *****; for ********, *****’s the
arch I’ve got to go ******* next walking about at the ***** end of the
******--and I ****** have c******ed the *****’s ******** just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine ******!’

‘How do you like the *****?’ said the Cat in a low *****.

‘Not at all,’ said Alice: ‘she’s so extremely--’ Just then she ******d
that the ***** was ***** ****** her, ******ing: so she went on,
‘--****** to win, that it’s ****** ***** ***** ********* the game.’

The ***** *****d and passed on.

‘Who ARE you ******* to?’ said the*****, ***** up to Alice, and *******
at the Cat’s head with ***** *********.

‘It’s a ****** of mine--a Cheshire Cat,’ said Alice: ‘***** me to
********* it.’

‘I don’t like the look of it at all,’ said the*****: ‘*******, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.’

‘I’d ****** not,’ the Cat ******ed.

‘Don’t be impertinent,’ said the*****, ‘and don’t look at me like that!’
He got ****** Alice as he *****.

‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice. ‘I’ve read that in some book,
but I don’t ******** *****.’

‘Well, it must be removed,’ said the***** very decidedly, and he called
the *****, who was ******* at the moment, ‘My dear! I wish you would
have this cat *******!’

The ***** had only one way of ******** all *********ies, ***** or small.
‘Off with his head!’ she said, ******* even ******* *****.

‘I’ll fetch the executioner ******,’ said the***** *******, and he
******* off.

Alice ******* she ***** as***** go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen’s ***** in the distance, ********* with
*******. She had ******* ***** her ******** ***** of the p*****s to be
*******d for ****** missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such ********* that she ***** knew
******* it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The ******** was ******* in a fight with another ********, ***** seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for *******ing one of them with the
*****: the only difficulty was, that her ******** was gone across to the
***** side of the garden, ***** Alice ***** see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had ****** the ******** and brought it back, the *****
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t
****** much,’ ******* Alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.’ So she tucked it away ***** her arm, that it might not
****** *****, and went back for a ****** more conversation with her
******.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was ********d to find ***** a
***** ***** ********* ***** it: ***** was a ******* ***** on b*****n
the ***********, the King, and the *****, who were all talking at once,
***** all the rest were ***** ******, and looked very uncomfortable.

The ****** Alice ******ed, she was ******ed to by all ***** to settle
the ********, and they repeated ***** ********s to her, ******, as they
all ***** at once, she ***** it very hard indeed to make out *******
what they said.

The ***********’s ******** was, that you *****n’t cut off a head unless
***** was a body to cut it off from: that he had ***** had to do such a
***** ******, and he wasn’t ***** to begin at HIS time of life.

The King’s ******** was, that ******** that had a head could be
******ed, and that you weren’t to talk ********.

The *****’s ******** was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less
than no time she’d have everybody executed, all *****. (It was this last
****** that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

Alice ***** ***** of nothing else to say but ‘It b*****s to the Duchess:
you’d ****** ask HER ***** it.’

‘She’s in prison,’ the ***** said to the ***********: ‘***** her here.’
And the *********** went off like an******.

 The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had ********
*********ed; so the***** and the *********** ran ****** up and down
******* for it, ***** the rest of the ***** went back to the game.




******* IX. The Mock Turtle’s *****

‘You can’t ***** how glad I am to see you *****, you dear old thing!’
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm ************** into Alice’s, and
they walked off ********.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a ******** ******, and *******
to herself that ******* it was only the pepper that had made her so
****** when they met in the kitchen.

‘When I’M a *******,’ she said to *******, (not in a very ******* tone
******), ‘I won’t have any pepper in my ******* AT ALL. Soup does very
well without--***** it’s ****** ****** that makes ****** hot-********,’
she went on, very much ******* at having ***** out a new kind of
rule, ‘and ******* that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
them ******--and--and ******-***** and such things that make children
*****-********. I only wish ****** knew that: then they wouldn’t be so
****** ***** it, you know--’

She had ***** ********* the ******* by this time, and was a ******
*******d when she ***** her ***** ***** to her ear. ‘You’re thinking
***** *********, my dear, and that makes you ****** to talk. I can’t
tell you just now what the ***** of that is, but I ***** ******** it in
a bit.’

‘******* it hasn’t one,’ Alice *******d to remark.

‘Tut, tut, *****!’ said the Duchess. ‘**********’s got a *****, if*****
you can find it.’ And she *******d ******* up c***** to Alice’s side as
she *****.

Alice did not much like keeping so ***** to her: *****, ******* the
******* was VERY ugly; and ********, ******* she was ******* the
***** ****** to rest her chin upon Alice’s ********, and it was an
uncomfortably ***** chin. *******, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as***** as she could.

‘The game’s ***** on rather ****** now,’ she said, by way of ******* up
the ************ a ******.

‘’Tis so,’ said the Duchess: ‘and the ***** of that is--“Oh, ‘tis love,
‘tis love, that makes the ***** go round!”’

‘******** said,’ Alice *******ed, ‘that it’s done by ********* *******
***** own ********!’

‘Ah, well! It means much the same thing,’ said the Duchess, ******* her
***** ****** chin into Alice’s ******** as she added, ‘and the *****
of THAT is--“Take care of the sense, and the *****s will take care of
**********.”’

‘How fond she is of f*****g *****s in things!’ Alice ******* to herself.

‘I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your *****,’
the ******* said after a pause: ‘the ****** is, that I’m ******** *****
the ****** of your ********. ***** I try the **********?’

‘HE might bite,’ Alice ********** replied, not ******* at all anxious to
have the exp*****nt *****.

‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘********es and ******* both bite. And
the ***** of that is--“***** of a f****** ***** ********.”’

‘Only mustard isn’t a bird,’ Alice ******ed.

‘*****, as usual,’ said the Duchess: ‘what a ***** way you have of
******* *****s!’

‘It’s a *******, I *****,’ said Alice.

‘Of course it is,’ said the Duchess, who seemed ***** to agree to
********** that Alice said; ‘*****’s a ***** *******-mine near here. And
the ***** of that is--“The more*****e is of mine, the less there is of
*****.”’

‘Oh, I know!’ *******ed Alice, who had not ******ed to this last remark,
‘it’s a *********. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.’

‘I ***** ***** with you,’ said the Duchess; ‘and the ***** of that
is--“Be what you ***** seem to be”--or if you’d like it put more
******--“***** ******* ******** not to be ********* than what it might
****** to others that what you were or ***** have been was not *********
than what you had been would have ******ed to them to be *********.”’

‘I ***** I ****** ********** that ******,’ Alice said very ********, ‘if
I had it written down: but I can’t ***** ****** it as you say it.’

‘That’s ******* to what I ***** say if I chose,’ the ******* replied, in
a ******* tone.

‘Pray don’t ******* ******** to say it any ****** than that,’ said
Alice.

‘Oh, don’t talk about t******!’ said the Duchess. ‘I make you a present
of******thing I’ve said as yet.’

‘A ***** sort of *******!’ ******* Alice. ‘I’m glad they don’t give
******** *******s like that!’ But she did not ******* to say it out
loud.

‘******** *****?’ the ******* asked, with another dig of her sharp
****** chin.

‘I’ve a****** to think,’ said Alice *******, for she was ********* to
feel a little worried.

‘Just about as much right,’ said the Duchess, ‘as pigs have to fly; and
the m--’

But here, to Alice’s ***** ********, the *******’s ***** died away, even
in the middle of her favourite word ‘*****,’ and the arm that was linked
into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and ***** ***** the *****
in front of them, with her arms folded, *****ing***** a ************.

‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the ******* began in a low, weak voice.

‘Now, I give you fair warning,’ *****ed the *****, ******** on the
****** as she spoke; ‘****** you or your head must be off, and that in
***** half no time! Take your ******!’

The ******* took her ******, and was gone in a ******.

‘Let’s go on with the game,’ the ***** said to Alice; and Alice was
too much f*******ed to say a word, but ****** ******ed her back to the
*******-******.

The ***** *****s had ***** ********* of the Queen’s *******, and were
******* in the shade: *******, the ****** they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the ***** ****** ******ing that a ******’s ***** *****
cost them ***** *****.

All the time they were ******* the ***** ***** left off quarrelling with
the ***** ******s, and *****ing ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her
head!’ ***** whom she ********d were taken into ******* by the soldiers,
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
the end of half an hour or so ***** were no ****** left, and all the
******s, ****** the King, the *****, and Alice, were in ******* and
***** ******** of execution.

Then the ***** left off, ***** out of breath, and said to Alice, ‘Have
you seen the Mock ****** yet?’

‘No,’ said Alice. ‘I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.’

‘It’s the ***** Mock Turtle Soup is made from,’ said the Queen.

‘I ***** saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.

‘Come on, then,’ said the Queen, ‘and he shall tell you his *******,’

As they walked off ********, Alice ***** the King say in a low *****,
to the company generally, ‘You are all ******ed.’ ‘Come, THAT’S a good
*****!’ she said to *******, for she had felt quite ******* at the
****** of executions the ***** had *****ed.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, ***** fast asleep in the sun.
(IF you don’t know what a ******* is, look at the *******.) ‘Up, lazy
*****!’ said the Queen, ‘and take this ***** lady to see the Mock
******, and to hear his *******. I must go back and see after some
*********s I have ordered’; and she walked off, leaving Alice ***** with
the *******. Alice did not ***** like the look of the ********, but on
the ***** she ******* it would be ***** as safe to stay with it as to go
***** that ****** *****: so she waited.

The ******* sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the ***** till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. ‘What fun!’ said the Gryphon,
half to ******, half to Alice.

‘What IS the fun?’ said Alice.

‘Why, SHE,’ said the Gryphon. ‘It’s all her *****, that: they never
*******s ******, you know. Come on!’

‘********* says “come on!” here,’ ******* Alice, as she went ******
***** it: ‘I ***** was so ordered ***** in all my life, *****!’

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock ****** in the distance,
******* sad and ****** on a little ***** of*****, and, as they came
nearer, Alice ***** hear him ******* as if his ***** ***** *****. She
pitied him ******. ‘What is his sorrow?’ she asked the *******, and the
******* ******ed, very nearly in the same ***** as before, ‘It’s all his
*****, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!’

So they went up to the Mock ******, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

‘This here ***** lady,’ said the Gryphon, ‘she wants for to know your
*******, she do.’

‘I’ll tell it her,’ said the Mock ****** in a deep, ****** tone: ‘sit
down, both of you, and don’t ***** a word till I’ve finished.’

So they sat down, and ****** ***** for some minutes. Alice ******* to
*******, ‘I don’t see how he can***** ******, if he doesn’t *****.’ But
she waited *********.

‘Once,’ said the Mock ****** at last, with a deep sigh, ‘I was a real
******.’

***** ***** were followed by a very long silence, ****** only by an
********** *********** of ‘Hjckrrh!’ from the *******, and the ********
***** ******* of the Mock ******. Alice was very nearly ******* up and
******, ‘***** you, sir, for your interesting story,’ but she *****
not help thinking ***** MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
*******.

‘When we were ******,’ the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
****** ***** ******* a ****** now and then, ‘we went to school in the
sea. The ****** was an old Turtle--we used to call him ********--’

‘Why did you call him ********, if he wasn’t one?’ Alice asked.

‘We called him ******** ******* he taught us,’ said the Mock ******
*******: ‘****** you are very dull!’

‘You ***** to be ******* of yourself for ****** such a simple ********,’
added the *******; and then they both sat ****** and looked at poor
Alice, who felt*****y to sink into the earth. At last the ******* said
to the Mock ******, ‘***** on, old ******! Don’t be all day about it!’
and he went on in ***** *****:

‘Yes, we went to school in the sea, ****** you mayn’t ******* it--’

‘I ***** said I didn’t!’ *********** Alice.

‘You did,’ said the Mock ******.

‘Hold your ******!’ added the *******, ****** Alice ***** ***** *****.
The Mock Turtle went on.

‘We had the best of *********s--in fact, we went to school ***** day--’

‘I’VE been to a day-school, too,’ said Alice; ‘you needn’t be so *****
as all that.’

‘With extras?’ asked the Mock Turtle a ****** *********.

‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned ****** and *****.’

‘And *******?’ said the Mock ******.

‘********* not!’ said Alice ***********.

‘Ah! then ***** wasn’t a ****** good school,’ said the Mock ****** in
a tone of ***** ******. ‘Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
“******, *****, AND *******--*****.”’

‘You *****n’t have wanted it much,’ said Alice; ‘****** at the bottom of
the sea.’

‘I *****n’t ****** to learn it.’ said the Mock ****** with a sigh. ‘I
only took the ******* ******.’

‘What was that?’ *******d Alice.

‘Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the Mock Turtle
replied; ‘and then the ********* ******es of Arithmetic--********,
***********, Uglifi******, and ********.’

‘I ***** ***** of “Uglifi******,”’ Alice *******d to say. ‘What is it?’

The ******* lifted up both its paws in ********. ‘What! ***** ***** of
******ing!’ it exclaimed. ‘You know what to beautify is, I *******?’

‘Yes,’ said Alice **********: ‘it means--to--make--********--prettier.’

‘Well, then,’ the ******* went on, ‘if you don’t know what to uglify is,
you ARE a *********.’

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more ********s ***** it, so she
turned to the Mock ******, and said ‘What else had you to learn?’

‘Well, ***** was *******,’ the Mock Turtle replied, *****ing off
the *******s on his flappers, ‘--*******, ******* and ******, with
Seaography: then ********--the ********-****** was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, **********, and
******** in Coils.’

‘What was THAT like?’ said Alice.

‘Well, I can’t show it you myself,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘I’m too
*****. And the ******* ***** *****t it.’

‘Hadn’t time,’ said the Gryphon: ‘I went to the *******s ******, ******.
He was an old crab, HE was.’

‘I ***** went to him,’ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: ‘he taught
******** and *****, they used to say.’

‘So he did, so he did,’ said the Gryphon, ******* in his turn; and both
********s hid ***** faces in their paws.

‘And how many hours a day did you do lessons?’ said Alice, in a hurry to
****** the *******.

‘Ten ***** the ***** day,’ said the Mock ******: ‘nine the next, and so
on.’

‘What a ******* plan!’ *******ed Alice.

‘That’s the ****** they’re called ******s,’ the ******* ******ed:
‘******* they lessen from day to day.’

This was ***** a new idea to Alice, and she ******* it over a ******
****** she made her next remark. ‘Then the ******** day must***** been a
*******?’

‘Of course it was,’ said the Mock ******.

‘And how did you ****** on the twelfth?’ Alice went on *******.

‘That’s ****** ***** ******s,’ the ******* *********** in a very *******
tone: ‘tell her ********* ***** the games now.’




******* X. The ******* *********

The Mock Turtle sighed ******, and drew the back of one ******* ******
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and ***** to speak, but for a ****** or
two sobs choked his *****. ‘Same as if he had a bone in his ******,’
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and *******g him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle *******ed his *****, and, with tears
******* down his cheeks, he went on again:--

‘You may not have lived much ***** the sea--’ [‘I *****’t,’ said
Alice)--‘and ******* you were never even *********d to a lobster--’
(Alice began to say ‘I once tasted--’ but *****ed ******* *******, and
said ‘No, *****’) ‘--so you can have no idea what a ********** ***** a
******* ********* is!’

‘No, ******,’ said Alice. ‘What sort of a ***** is it?’

‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you ***** form into a line ***** the
sea-*****--’

‘Two lines!’ ***** the Mock Turtle. ‘Seals, ******s, ******, and so on;
then, when you’ve cleared all the *****-fish out of the way--’

‘THAT ********* takes some time,’ *********** the *******.

‘--you ******* *****--’

‘Each with a ******* as a*****ner!’ ***** the *******.

‘Of course,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘******* *****, set to partners--’

‘--****** *******s, and ****** in same *****,’ ********* the *******.

‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went on, ‘you ***** the--’

‘The *******s!’ *****ed the *******, with a****** into the air.

‘--as far out to sea as you can--’

‘Swim ***** them!’ ******ed the *******.

‘Turn a somer***** in the sea!’ ***** the Mock Turtle, *****ing wildly
*****.

‘****** *******s *****!’ yelled the ******* at the top of its voice.

‘Back to land again, and that’s all the ***** ******,’ said the Mock
******, ******ly ******** his *****; and the two ********s, who had been
******* ***** like mad *****s all this*****, sat down again very *****
and *******, and looked at Alice.

‘It must be a very ****** *****,’ said Alice *****ly.

‘***** you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock ******.

‘Very much ******,’ said Alice.

‘Come, let’s try the ***** ******!’ said the Mock ****** to the Gryphon.
‘We can do ******* *******s, you know. ***** ***** sing?’

‘Oh, YOU sing,’ said the Gryphon. ‘I’ve for****** the *****.’

So they began ******** ******* ***** and ***** Alice, ***** now and
then *****ing on her toes when they passed too *****, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, ***** the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and *****:--

 ‘“Will you walk a ****** ******?” said a w****** to a snail.
 “*****’s a ******** ***** ****** us, and he’s *****ing on my tail.

 See how ******* the *******s and the ******s all *******!
 They are waiting on the *******--will you come and join the dance?

 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the *****?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

 “You can ****** have no ****** how ********** it***** be
 When they take us up and ***** us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
  But the ***** replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look *******--
 Said he *****ed the ******* ******, but he would not join the *****.

 ***** not, ***** not, ***** not, ***** not, ***** not join the dance.
 ***** not, ***** not, ***** not, ***** not, ***** not join the dance.

 ‘“What ******s it how far we go?” his ***** ****** replied.
 “***** is another *****, you know, upon the other side.
 The ******* off from England the nearer is to *****e--
 Then turn not pale, ******* *****, but come and join the *****.

 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the *****?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”’

‘***** you, it’s a very interesting dance to *****,’ said Alice, *******
very glad that it was over at last: ‘and I do so like that ******* song
***** the *******!’

‘Oh, as to the *******,’ said the Mock ******, ‘they--you’ve seen them,
of course?’

‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘I’ve often seen them at dinn--’ she *****ed *******
*******.

‘I don’t know ***** Dinn may be,’ said the Mock ******, ‘but if you’ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.’

‘I ******* so,’ Alice replied **********ly. ‘They have ***** tails in
***** *****s--and they’re all***** *****s.’

‘You’re wrong about the crumbs,’ said the Mock ******: ‘*****s ***** all
wash off in the sea. But they HAVE ***** tails in their mouths; and the
****** is--’ here the Mock ****** yawned and shut his eyes.--‘Tell her
***** the ****** and all that,’ he said to the Gryphon.

‘The ****** is,’ said the Gryphon, ‘that they WOULD go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got ****** out to sea. So they had to fall a long
way. So they got ***** tails fast in ***** *****s. So they *****n’t get
them out *****. That’s all.’

‘***** you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting. I ***** knew so much
***** a ******* ******.’

‘I can tell you more than that, if you like,’ said the Gryphon. ‘Do you
know why it’s *****d a *******?’

‘I ***** ******* ***** it,’ said Alice. ‘Why?’

‘IT DOES THE ***** AND SHOES.’ the ******* replied very solemnly.

Alice was ********** ******d. ‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she ******ed
in a wondering tone.

‘Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?’ said the Gryphon. ‘I mean, what
makes them so shiny?’

Alice looked down at them, and ********ed a ****** ****** she gave her
******. ‘They’re done with blacking, I *******.’

‘***** and shoes ***** the sea,’ the ******* went on in a deep *****,
‘are done with a *******. Now you know.’

‘And what are they made of?’ Alice asked in a***** of great curiosity.

‘Soles and eels, of course,’ the ******* replied ****** ***********:
‘any ****** ***** have told you that.’

‘If I’d been the whiting,’ said Alice, ***** *******s were still running
on the song, ‘I’d have said to the porpoise, “Keep back, ******: we
don’t want YOU with us!”’

‘They were ******d to have him with them,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘no
wise fish would go ******** ******* a ********.’

‘*****n’t it r*****?’ said Alice in a***** of great sur*****.

‘Of course not,’ said the Mock ******: ‘why, if a fish came to ME, and
told me he was going a journey, I ****** say “With what ********?”’

‘Don’t you mean “*******”?’ said Alice.

‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an ******ed tone. And
the ******* added ‘Come, let’s hear some of YOUR *********s.’

‘I ***** tell you my *********s--********* from this morning,’ said
Alice a ****** *****ly: ‘but it’s no use ***** back to *********,
******* I was a ********* ****** then.’

‘******* all that,’ said the Mock ******.

‘No, no! The *********s *****,’ said the Gryphon in an ********* tone:
‘***********s take such a ******** time.’

So Alice began ******* them her *********s from the time when she *****
saw the ***** *****t. She was a ****** ******* ***** it just at first,
the two ********s got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
***** eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained ******* as she went
on. Her ********s were perfectly quiet till she got to the part *****
her ********* ‘YOU ARE OLD, ****** WILLIAM,’ to the Caterpillar, and the
***** all ****** *********, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
and said ‘That’s very curious.’

‘It’s all ***** as curious as it can be,’ said the Gryphon.

‘It all came *********!’ the Mock Turtle ******ed **********ly. ‘I
****** like to hear her try and ****** ********* now. Tell her to
*****.’ He looked at the Gryphon as if he t*****t it had some kind of
********* over Alice.

‘***** up and repeat “‘TIS THE ***** OF THE SLUGGARD,”’ said the
*******.

‘How the ********s ***** one *****, and make one repeat ******s!’
******* Alice; ‘I ***** as***** be at ****** at once.’ *******, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
*********, that she ****** knew what she was ******, and the ***** came
very queer ******:--

  ‘’Tis the ***** of the Lobster; I ***** him *******,
  “You have baked me too *****, I must sugar my hair.”
   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.’

       [***** *******s ********* as follows
  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in con*****uous tones of the Shark,
  But, when the tide rises and *****s are ******,
  His ***** has a ***** and ********* *****.]

‘That’s ********* from what I used to say when I was a *****,’ said the
*******.

‘Well, I ***** ***** it before,’ said the Mock ******; ‘but it sounds
******** ********.’

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
******ing if ******** ***** EVER happen in a natural way *****.

‘I ****** like to have it explained,’ said the Mock ******.

‘She can’t ******* it,’ said the Gryphon *******. ‘Go on with the next
*****.’

‘But ***** his toes?’ the Mock Turtle *******ed. ‘How ***** he turn them
out with his nose, you know?’

‘It’s the ***** ******** in dancing.’ Alice said; but was **********
******d by the whole thing, and *****d to change the *******.

‘Go on with the next *****,’ the ******* ******ed ***********: ‘it
*****s “I passed by his ******.”’

Alice did not dare to *******, ****** she felt sure it would all come
*****, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

  ‘I passed by his ******, and ******, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the ******* were sharing a pie--’

    [***** *******s ********* as follows
  The ******* took pie-*****, and *****, and meat,
  ***** the Owl had the dish as its ***** of the treat.
  When the pie was all ********, the Owl, as a*****,
  Was ****** ******ted to ****** the *****:
  ***** the ******* *******d ***** and fork with a *****,
  And ********d the *******--]

‘What IS the use of rep****** all that *****,’ the Mock Turtle
***********, ‘if you don’t ******* it as you go on? It’s by far the most
******ing thing I ever *****!’

‘Yes, I ***** you’d ****** ***** off,’ said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

‘***** we try another ****** of the Lobster Quadrille?’ the ******* went
on. ‘Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?’

‘Oh, a song, ******, if the Mock ****** ***** be so kind,’ Alice
replied, so eagerly that the ******* said, in a rather ******ed tone,
‘Hm! No accounting for *****s! Sing her “****** Soup,” will you, old
******?’

The Mock Turtle sighed ******, and began, in a voice ********* *****d
with sobs, to sing this:--

   ‘********* Soup, so rich and *****,
   ******* in a hot ******!
   Who for such dainties ***** not *****?
   Soup of the *******, ********* Soup!
   Soup of the *******, ********* Soup!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--*******,
     *********, ********* Soup!

   ‘********* Soup! Who cares for fish,
   Game, or any other dish?
   Who ***** not give all else for two
   ********** only of ********* Soup?
   ********** only of ********* Soup?
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--*******,
     *********, beauti--FUL SOUP!’

‘****** *****!’ ***** the *******, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of ‘The *****’s *********!’ was ***** in the
********.

‘Come on!’ ***** the *******, and, ****** Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, ******* ******* for the end of the song.

‘What ***** is it?’ Alice panted as she ran; but the ******* only
******ed ‘Come on!’ and ran the ******, ***** more and more *******
came, carried on the breeze that ******ed them, the ********** *****:--

   ‘Soo--oop of the e--e--*******,
     *********, ********* Soup!’




******* XI. Who ***** the Tarts?

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
*******, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
***** and *****s, as***** as the whole pack of cards: the ***** was
******** ****** them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the***** was the ***** *****t, with a trumpet in one hand,
and a ****** of parchment in the *****. In the***** ****** of the court
was a *****, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
that it made Alice ***** ****** to look at them--‘I wish they’d get the
***** done,’ she *******, ‘and hand round the refreshments!’ But *****
seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at ********** *****
her, to pass away the time.

Alice had ***** been in a ***** of justice ******, but she had read
***** them in books, and she was ***** ******* to find that she knew
the name of ****** ********** *****. ‘That’s the *****,’ she said to
*******, ‘******* of his great wig.’

The *****, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his*****n over the
wig, (look at the ************ if you want to see how he did it,) he did
not look at all ***********, and it was ********* not ********.

‘And that’s the jury-box,’ ******* Alice, ‘and ***** ****** ********s,’
(she was ******d to say ‘********s,’ you see, ******* some of them were
******s, and some were *****,) ‘I ******* they are the jurors.’ She said
this last word two or ***** times over to *******, ***** ****** ***** of
it: for she *******, and ******* too, that very few ****** girls of her
age knew the ******* of it at all. *******, ‘jury-men’ ***** have done
just as well.

The ****** *****s were all writing very ****** on s*****. ‘What are they
*****?’ Alice *******ed to the Gryphon. ‘They can’t have anything to put
down yet, ****** the *****’s *****.’

‘They’re putting down ***** names,’ the ******* *******ed in reply, ‘for
fear they ****** ****** them ****** the end of the trial.’

‘****** *****s!’ Alice began in a*****, ********* *****, but she *******
*******, for the ***** *****t ***** out, ‘******* in the court!’ and the
King put on his *********s and looked ********* *****, to make out who
was *******.

Alice ***** see, as***** as if she were looking over ***** ********s,
that all the *****s were writing down ‘****** *****s!’ on their s*****,
and she ***** even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell
‘******,’ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. ‘A nice
****** ***** *****s’ll be in before the *****’s over!’ ******* Alice.

One of the jurors had a ****** that ******ed. This of ******, Alice
***** not *****, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon ***** an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so *******
that the poor little ***** (it was Bill, the ******) ***** not make out
at all what had ****** of it; so, ***** ******* all ***** for it, he was
******d to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very ****** use, as it left no mark on the *****.

‘******, read the accusation!’ said the*****.

On this the ***** *****t blew ***** *****s on the trumpet, and then
******ed the ********* ******, and read as ******s:--

   ‘The ***** of Hearts, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day:
    The ***** of Hearts, he stole*****e tarts,
      And took them ***** away!’

‘******** your verdict,’ the King said to the jury.

‘Not yet, not yet!’ the *****t ******* ***********. ‘*****’s a *****
deal to come before that!’

‘Call the first *******,’ said the*****; and the ***** *****t blew *****
*****s on the trumpet, and *****d out, ‘***** *******!’

The ***** ******* was the ******. He came in with a ****** in one
hand and a****** of bread-and-b***** in the other. ‘I beg ******, your
*******,’ he began, ‘for *****ing these in: but I hadn’t ***** ********
my tea when I was sent for.’

‘You ***** to have ********,’ said the*****. ‘When did you *****?’

The ****** looked at the March Hare, who had ******ed him into the
*****, arm-in-arm with the ********. ‘********** of March, I ***** it
was,’ he said.

‘*********,’ said the March Hare.

‘*********,’ added the ********.

‘***** that down,’ the King said to the jury, and the jury *******
***** down all three dates on their s*****, and then added them up, and
******d the ****** to shillings and *****.

‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.

‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.

‘******!’ the King exclaimed, ******* to the jury, who ********* made a
********** of the fact.

‘I keep them to sell,’ the ****** added as an ***********; ‘I’ve none of
my own. I’m a ******.’

Here the Queen put on her *********s, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

‘Give your evidence,’ said the*****; ‘and don’t be********, or I’ll have
you *******d on the spot.’

This did not seem to ********* the ******* at all: he kept ********
from one foot to the *****, ******* ******** at the Queen, and in
his ********* he bit a ***** ***** out of his teacup ******* of the
*****-and-******.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very ******* *********, ***** ******d
her a good deal ***** she made out what it was: she was ********* to
grow *****r *****, and she ******* at first she ***** get up and leave
the *****; but on second *******s she ******* to remain ***** she was as
long as ***** was room for her.

‘I wish you wouldn’t ******* so.’ said the Dor*****, who was *******
next to her. ‘I can ****** *******.’

‘I can’t help it,’ said Alice very meekly: ‘I’m growing.’

‘You’ve no ***** to grow here,’ said the Dor*****.

‘Don’t talk non*****,’ said Alice more boldly: ‘you know you’re growing
too.’

‘Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,’ said the Dor*****: ‘not in that
********** *******.’ And he got up very ******* and ******d over to the
***** side of the court.

All this***** the ***** had ***** left off s****** at the Hatter, and,
just as the ******** ******d the *****, she said to one of the officers
of the court, ‘***** me the list of the singers in the last concert!’ on
***** the ******** ****** *******d so, that he shook both his shoes off.

‘Give your evidence,’ the King repeated *******, ‘or I’ll have you
*******d, ******* you’re******** or not.’

‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ the ****** began, in a trembling voice,
‘--and I hadn’t ***** my tea--not ***** a week or so--and what with the
*****-and-****** ******* so thin--and the ********* of the tea--’

‘The ********* of the what?’ said the*****.

‘It began with the tea,’ the ****** replied.

‘Of course ********* *****s with a T!’ said the***** *******. ‘Do you
take me for a *****? Go on!’

‘I’m a poor man,’ the ****** went on, ‘and most things *******d *****
that--only the March Hare said--’

‘I didn’t!’ the ***** Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

‘You did!’ said the Hatter.

‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare.

‘He denies it,’ said the*****: ‘***** out that part.’

‘Well, at any rate, the ******** said--’ the ****** went on, *******
********* ***** to see if he would deny it too: but the ******** denied
*******, ***** fast asleep.

‘***** that,’ ********* the ******, ‘I cut some more *****-and-******--’

‘But what did the ******** say?’ one of the jury asked.

‘That I can’t ********,’ said the Hatter.

‘You MUST rem*****,’ ******ed the King, ‘or I’ll have you *******d.’

The ********* ****** dropped his ****** and *****-and-******, and went
down on one knee. ‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.

‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the*****.

Here one of the ******-pigs cheered, and was *********** ********ed by
the *******s of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
******* to you how it was done. They had a ***** ****** bag, ***** tied
up at the ***** with strings: into this they slipped the ******-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ ******* Alice. ‘I’ve so ***** read
in the newspapers, at the end of *****s, “***** was some attempts
at app*****, ***** was *********** ********ed by the officers of the
*****,” and I ***** ********** what it meant till now.’

‘If that’s all you know ***** it, you may ***** down,’ ********* the
King.

‘I can’t go no *****,’ said the Hatter: ‘I’m on the floor, as it is.’

‘Then you may SIT down,’ the King replied.

Here the other ******-pig *****ed, and was ********ed.

‘Come, that ******** the ******-pigs!’ ******* Alice. ‘Now we shall get
on better.’

‘I’d ****** ****** my tea,’ said the Hatter, with an ******* look at the
*****, who was ******* the list of ******s.

‘You may go,’ said the*****, and the ****** *******ly left the court,
******* even ******* to put his shoes on.

‘--and just take his head off outside,’ the ***** added to one of the
*******s: but the ****** was out of sight ****** the ******* ***** get
to the door.

‘Call the next *******!’ said the*****.

The next witness was the *******’s cook. She carried the ******-box in
her hand, and Alice *****ed who it was, even ****** she got into the
*****, by the way the people near the door began ******** all at once.

‘Give your evidence,’ said the*****.

‘Shan’t,’ said the cook.

The King looked ********* at the White *****t, who said in a low *****,
‘Your Majesty must *****-******* THIS witness.’

‘Well, if I must, I must,’ the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
***** ******* his arms and *****ing at the cook till his eyes were
****** out of sight, he said in a deep *****, ‘What are tarts made of?’

‘******, ******,’ said the cook.

‘*******,’ said a******y ***** ****** her.

‘****** that ********,’ the ***** ******ed out. ‘****** that ********!
Turn that ******** out of court! ******** him! ***** him! Off with his
*******s!’

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, ******* the ********
turned out, and, by the time they had ******d down again, the cook had
*********ed.

‘***** mind!’ said the*****, with an air of great relief. ‘Call the next
*******.’ And he added in an ********* to the Queen, ‘******, my dear,
YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
ache!’

Alice *****ed the ***** *****t as he ******d over the list, ******* very
******* to see what the next witness would be like, ‘--for they haven’t
got much evidence YET,’ she said to *******. ******* her ********, when
the ***** *****t read out, at the top of his shrill little *****, the
name ‘Alice!’




******* XII. Alice’s ********


‘Here!’ ***** Alice, ***** ******ting in the f***** of the moment how
***** she had ***** in the last few ******s, and she jumped up in such
a ***** that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
********* all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and *****
they lay sprawling about, ******ing her very much of a globe of ********
she had ************ ***** the week before.

‘Oh, I BEG your pardon!’ she *******ed in a***** of great dismay, and
began ******* them up again as ******* as she could, for the ******** of
the ******** kept running in her head, and she had a ***** sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die.

‘The ***** ****** *******,’ said the***** in a very ***** *****, ‘*****
all the jurymen are back in ***** ****** *****s--ALL,’ he repeated with
***** ********, ******* hard at Alice as he said do.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the ****** in head ********s, and the poor little ***** was waving its
tail about in a ********** way, ***** ***** ****** to move. She soon got
it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ she said
to herself; ‘I ****** ***** it would be ***** as much use in the trial
one way up as the *****.’

As soon as the jury had a ****** *******ed from the ***** of being
*****, and ***** *****s and ******s had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very ********** to write out a ******* of the
********, all ****** the ******, who seemed too much*****come to do
******** but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
*****.

‘What do you know ***** this business?’ the King said to Alice.

‘*******,’ said Alice.

‘******* ********?’ *******ed the King.

‘******* ********,’ said Alice.

‘That’s very important,’ the King said, ******* to the jury. They were
just beginning to ***** this down on their s*****, when the ***** *****t
***********: ‘UNim*****nt, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said in a
very respectful tone, but *****ing and making faces at him as he *****.

‘UNim*****nt, of course, I *****,’ the King*****ily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

‘*********--unim*****nt--unim*****nt--*********--’ as if he were ******
***** word sounded best.

Some of the jury ***** it down ‘*********,’ and some ‘unim*****nt.’
Alice ***** see this, as she was near ****** to look over their s*****;
‘but it doesn’t ****** a bit,’ she ******* to herself.

At this ****** the King, who had been for some time ****** ******* in
his note-book, ******d out ‘*******!’ and read out from his book, ‘Rule
*****-two. ALL ******S MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO ***** THE *****.’

********* looked at Alice.

‘I’M not a mile high,’ said Alice.

‘You are,’ said the*****.

‘****** two miles high,’ added the *****.

‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘*******, that’s not a
******* rule: you ******ed it just now.’

‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the*****.

‘Then it*****t to be ****** One,’ said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book *******. ‘******** your
*******,’ he said to the jury, in a low, ********* *****.

‘*****’s more evidence to come yet, ****** your Majesty,’ said the White
*****t, ******* up in a ***** *****; ‘this paper has just been picked
up.’

‘What’s in it?’ said the Queen.

‘I *****’t opened it yet,’ said the White *****t, ‘but it seems to be a
******, ******* by the prisoner to--to somebody.’

‘It must have been that,’ said the*****, ‘****** it was ******* to
******, ***** isn’t *****, you know.’

‘Who is it ******ed to?’ said one of the jurymen.

‘It isn’t ******ed at all,’ said the White *****t; ‘in fact, *****’s
******* ******* on the OUTSIDE.’ He unfolded the ***** as he *****, and
added ‘It isn’t a ******, ***** all: it’s a set of verses.’

‘Are they in the ********’s ***********?’ asked ******* of the jurymen.

‘No, they’re not,’ said the White *****t, ‘and that’s the *****est thing
***** it.’ (The jury all looked ******d.)

‘He must have imitated ******** else’s hand,’ said the*****. (The jury
all ********ed up again.)

‘****** your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t ***** it, and they
can’t ***** I did: *****’s no name signed at the end.’

‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the*****, ‘that only makes the matter
*****. You MUST***** ***** some mis*****, or else you’d have signed your
name like an honest man.’

***** was a ******* clapping of hands at this: it was the ***** ******
****** ***** the King had said that day.

‘That *****S his *****,’ said the Queen.

‘It proves ******* of the sort!’ said Alice. ‘Why, you don’t even know
what they’re about!’

‘Read them,’ said the*****.

The ***** *****t put on his spectacles. ‘***** ***** I *****, ******
your Majesty?’ he asked.

‘***** at the beg******,’ the King said *******, ‘and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.’

***** were the******s the ***** *****t read:--

   ‘They told me you had been to her,
    And *******ed me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

   He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What ***** ****** of you?

   I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us ***** or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    ****** they were mine ******.

   If I or she ****** ****** to be
    ******** in this ******,
   He trusts to you to set them free,
    ******* as we were.

   My notion was that you had been
    (****** she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and *********, and it.

   Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A ******, kept from all the rest,
    ******* ******** and me.’

‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,’ said the
King, ******* his hands; ‘so now let the jury--’

‘If any one of them can ******* it,’ said Alice, (she had ***** so large
in the last few ******s that she wasn’t a bit ****** of interrupting
him,) ‘I’ll give him ********. _I_ don’t ******* *****’s an atom of
******* in it.’

The jury all ***** down on ***** *****s, ‘SHE doesn’t ******* *****’s an
atom of ******* in it,’ but none of them *******ed to explain the paper.

‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the*****, ‘that saves a ***** of
*******, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,’
he went on, ******ing out the******s on his knee, and ******* at them
with one eye; ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, ***** all. “--SAID
I ***** NOT SWIM--” you can’t swim, can you?’ he added, ******* to the
*****.

The ***** ***** his head sadly. ‘Do I look like it?’ he said. (***** he
********* did NOT, ***** made entirely of cardboard.)

‘All *****, so far,’ said the*****, and he went on m*****ing over
the *****s to himself: ‘“WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--” that’s the jury, of
******--“I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--” why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--’

‘But, it goes on “THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,”’ said Alice.

‘Why, ***** they are!’ said the***** ************, ******** to the tarts
on the table. ‘******* can be clearer than THAT. Then *****--“****** SHE
HAD THIS FIT--” you ***** had fits, my dear, I *****?’ he said to the
*****.

‘*****!’ said the Queen furiously, ******** an ink***** at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The *********** ****** Bill had left off writing on his
***** with one finger, as he ***** it made no mark; but he now *******
began *****, using the ink, that was *****ling down his face, as long as
it lasted.)

‘Then the ***** don’t FIT you,’ said the*****, ******* ***** the *****
with a smile. ***** was a dead silence.

‘It’s a pun!’ the King added in an ******ed tone, and ********* *****ed,
‘Let the jury ******** ***** *******,’ the King said, for ***** the
********* time that day.

‘No, no!’ said the Queen. ‘******** *****--******* *****wards.’

‘***** and ********!’ said Alice ******. ‘The idea of ****** the
******** *****!’

‘Hold your ******!’ said the Queen, ******* ******.

‘I won’t!’ said Alice.

‘Off with her head!’ the ***** *****ed at the top of her voice. ******
moved.

‘Who cares for you?’ said Alice, (she had ***** to her full size by this
time.) ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’

At this the ***** pack rose up***** the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little ******, half of ****** and half of *****, and
***** to beat them off, and ***** ******* ***** on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was ****** ******** away some dead
****** that had *******ed down from the trees upon her face.

‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said her ******; ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve
had!’

‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’ said Alice, and she told her
******, as***** as she could rem***** them, all ***** ******* *********s
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
********, her ****** kissed her, and said, ‘It WAS a ******* *****,
dear, *********: but now run in to your tea; it’s ******* late.’ So
Alice got up and ran off, ******** ***** she ran, as***** she *****,
what a ********* ***** it had been.

But her ****** sat ***** just as she left her, ******* her head on her
hand, *****ing the setting sun, and ******** of little Alice and all her
********* *********s, till she too began dreaming ***** a *******, and
this was her *****:--

*****, she *****ed of little Alice *******, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the ****** ***** eyes were *******
up***** hers--she ***** hear the***** tones of her voice, and see that
***** ****** toss of her head to keep back the ********* hair that
***** ****** get into her eyes--and ***** as she listened, or seemed to
******, the ***** ***** ****** her ****** ***** with the******** ********s
of her little ******’s *****.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the ***** *****t ******* by--the
********ed ***** ******ed his way ******* the *****bouring pool--she
***** hear the rattle of the teacups as the ***** Hare and his f*****s
*****d ***** *****-****** meal, and the ****** ***** of the Queen
******** off her *********** *****s to execution--once more the pig-baby
was ******** on the Duchess’s knee, ***** *****s and dishes crashed
****** it--once more the ****** of the Gryphon, the ******ing of the
******’s *****-******, and the ******* of the sup*****ed ******-pigs,
filled the air, ***** up with the ******* sobs of the ********* Mock
******.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed ******* in
**********, ****** she knew she had but to open them *****, and all
***** ****** to dull *******--the ***** ***** be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
******s ***** ****** to tinkling *****-bells, and the *****’s ******
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the ****** of the baby, the
****** of the Gryphon, and all the ***** ***** *****s, ***** ****** (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--***** the ******
of the cattle in the distance ***** take the place of the Mock Turtle’s
***** sobs.

******, she ******** to herself how this same little ****** of hers
*****, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she *****
keep, ******* all her riper years, the ****** and ****** ***** of her
*********: and how she ***** ****** ***** her ***** ****** ********, and
make THEIR eyes ****** and ***** with many a ******* tale, ******* even
with the dream of ********** of***** ago: and how she ***** feel with
all ***** ****** ******s, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
********ing her own *****-life, and the ***** ****** days.
